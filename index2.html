              >As a UX designer, empathizing with users enhances the products
              you create because you experience the product as your user does.
              The better you are at anticipating a user’s desires and needs, the
              more comfortable the user will feel with your design, and the more
              likely they will be to engage with your product long-term.

            <h3>How to empathize with users</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Ask lots of questions.</b> As a UX designer, you cannot make
                assumptions about the needs of your users. Instead, ask your
                users directly about their needs and wants, which your product
                design can address. Ask questions that begin with what, how, and
                why to gain a deeper understanding of your users’ perspective.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Become more observant.</b> Shift your focus to the whole user
                and not just the words they are using. In interviews where the
                user is physically present or on a video recording, watching a
                user interact with you or your product can provide physical cues
                that can affect your research outcomes. To help capture
                observations, you’ll take detailed notes or even record your
                sessions with users.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Be an active listener.</b> Active listening requires you to
                fully concentrate on, understand, and remember what is being
                said by the user you’re interacting with. Avoid getting
                distracted by where the conversation is going or what you might
                say next. In UX design, practicing active listening can help you
                get impartial feedback directly from your users, which you can
                apply to improve your designs.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Request input.</b> It’s important that the feedback you
                receive is objective and unbiased. Friends or colleagues often
                provide biased, mostly positive feedback because they want to
                support or please you. So, it’s important to request input from
                a variety of sources and a diverse group of users. When asking
                for feedback, use open-ended questions to understand the user’s
                actual thoughts on the experience or product.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Have an open mind.</b> We all have biases. Remember, a bias
                is favoring or having prejudice against something or someone,
                based on limited information. As UX designers, we have to set
                those biases aside to better empathize with others. Your goal is
                to understand users, not to complicate their feedback with your
                own opinions and emotions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Keep current on UX research.</b> Follow researchers and join
                online communities to stay up-to-date on the research that
                affects UX designers and the users you’re designing for.
                Research is always changing and evolving as we understand more
                about human psychology. Staying current will give you an
                advantage in how you understand and interact with your audience.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Empathy vs. sympathy</h4>
            <p>
              Empathy is sometimes confused with sympathy, but the two terms
              don’t mean the same thing. Empathy means understanding someone’s
              feelings or thoughts, often by feeling the emotions yourself.
              Sympathy is the experience of showing concern or compassion
              without feeling the emotions themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              Designing with empathy will enhance the products you create. By
              building deeper connections with users, you’ll better understand
              their perspectives and pain points. Finding that connection early
              can guide you down the right design path and save you from
              extensive revisions of your product during a later phase of the
              design process.

            <h3>Recruiting research participants</h3>
            <p>
              As you can probably imagine, recruiting participants who are
              available to be interviewed takes time and planning.
              <i
                >When you're on the job in the real world, you might start with
                a screener survey to help identify the best candidates to
                interview for your research study.</i
              >
              <b
                >A screener survey or simply screener, for short, is a detailed
                list of questions that helps researchers determine if potential
                participants meet the requirements of the research study</b
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whether you use a screener survey or just move straight to
              recruiting, you should
              <b>start with one important step: determine the interview goals</b
              >. To determine the goals of the interview, ask yourself questions
              like the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>What do you want to learn from the interviews?</li>
              <li>
                Are there certain user problems or pain points that you need to
                empathize with?
              </li>
              <li>
                Are there any characteristics of users you want to interview?
              </li>
              <li>Why?</li>
              <li>
                How much information should we have to ensure we get a
                comprehensive and balanced set of data?
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Write a clear list of goals to explain why you are conducting
              interviews, which will help determine the characteristics of
              participants who will be ideal for you to meet with.
            </p>
            <p>
              As you start recruiting, aim to form a representative sample.
              <b
                >A representative sample is a subset of the target population
                that seeks to accurately reflect the characteristics of the
                larger group</b
              >.
              <i
                >The participants in a representative sample should include user
                groups that have been commonly under-represented in previous
                research. This lack of representation is often the result of
                biases due to age, race, gender, or ability</i
              >. Having a diverse pool of participants to choose from will help
              you create great experiences for all users.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you are ready, reach out to each prospective participant. The
              most common way to do this is via email. Let's explore what you
              should include. Start with a greeting that introduces yourself and
              the project, then briefly explain why you are reaching out to
              them. Include logistics for the interview, like location, date,
              and time. Next, explain the setup for the interview. This is a
              good time to explain any parts of the interview that you'll need
              their consent for, like recording audio or video. Begin wrapping
              up your email by letting the participant know how they should
              confirm their interview time if they are interested. This can
              either be through a link to schedule their interview or through an
              email reply. If you have the budget, add an incentive like a gift
              card. This always helps sweeten the deal and makes participants
              excited to interview. Finally, close the email with a salutation
              and your name. After you confirm people to interview, it's a good
              idea to send email reminders the week before the interview and the
              night before the interview. This will help ensure that the people
              you've found actually show up for their interview.

          <h3>Determine research goals and questions</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>Determine research goals</h4>
              <p>
                You want to ensure that the interviews you conduct are
                worthwhile, both for you and for the participants. To make the
                most of your time together, you need to determine clear goals
                for the interview. As a UX designer, what do you want to learn
                from the interviews? Are there certain user problems or pain
                points that you need to empathize with?
              </p>
              <p>
                Here are some examples of common research goals when it comes to
                empathizing with users:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  I want to understand the processes and emotions that people
                  experience around the problem my product is trying to solve.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I want to identify common user behaviors and experiences with
                  tasks that my product is trying to address.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I want to understand user needs and frustrations as they
                  relate to the product I’m designing.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Write interview questions</h4>
              <p>
                Keeping the goals of the interview in mind, you can write your
                interview questions. The more aligned the interview questions
                are with your goals, the more useful the data you obtain will
                be. There are a few best practices to keep in mind when writing
                interview questions:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Ask open-ended questions.</b> Open-ended questions allow
                  the person being interviewed to answer freely, instead of with
                  a simple “yes” or “no.” For example, if you’re designing an
                  app to help people find dog walkers, you should ask “Could you
                  describe your experience with finding and scheduling dog
                  walkers?” instead of “Have you ever used an app to find a dog
                  walker?” Keep in mind that the questions you ask during
                  interviews should not lead or pressure participants towards a
                  desired response; instead, asking open-ended questions lets
                  participants share their true thoughts and perspectives.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Keep questions short and simple.</b>It should be easy for
                  interview participants to understand what you’re asking.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Ask follow-up questions.</b>During the empathize phase of
                  the design process, interviews should be conversational, so
                  encouraging participants to elaborate is a best practice.
                  After a participant answers an interview question, try asking
                  them “Why?” or use the phrase, “Tell me more about that” to
                  keep the conversation flowing.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

        <div>
          <h3>Activity Exemplar: Define your research goals and questions</h3>
          <p>
            Here is a completed exemplar along with an explanation of how the
            exemplar fulfills the expectations for the previous activity. This
            exemplar was completed for a food delivery app called Zia's Pizza.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>Interview goals:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  I want to understand common challenges people face trying to
                  manage a busy schedule and meal planning.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I want to identify frustrations people experience during the
                  process of ordering from a restaurant.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Interview questions:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Can you describe your current schedule and how you balance
                  your responsibilities with meal planning?
                </li>
                <li>
                  How often do you order meals from a restaurant? When you do,
                  what is your motivation for doing so?
                </li>
                <li>
                  What challenges do you face in the ordering process? How does
                  this make you feel?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Is there any way in which you feel these challenges could be
                  resolved?
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Target participant characteristics:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Ages 18-62</li>
                <li>Lives in metropolitan or suburban areas</li>
                <li>
                  People who order food from restaurants at least once a week
                </li>
                <li>Include participants of different genders</li>
                <li>Include participants with disabilities</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In this exemplar, interview goals specific to the app were defined.
            In this case, the goals were to learn more about the challenges
            people experience while trying to manage a busy schedule and meal
            planning, as well as some of the frustrations they experience while
            ordering from a restaurant. Understanding these goals going into the
            interview helped researchers understand the needs and struggles of
            the users the app is targeting.
          </p>
          <p>
            When choosing participants to interview, certain participant
            characteristics were identified to help ensure a representative
            sample was interviewed. For this example, the participant who was
            interviewed was Reena, a 37-year-old paramedic from a suburb near
            Denver, Colorado who eats out several nights a week and has a busy
            schedule. For your participants, it’s important to include a diverse
            but targeted group of users when conducting interviews in order to
            get the best data.

            Empathizing with users is critical when it comes to creating a great
            user experience. In order to empathize with users and understand
            their pain points, UX designers conduct interviews with real people
            who might use the product they’re designing.
          </p>
          <div>
            <h4>Create a screening survey to find the right participants</h4>
            <p>
              The participants you select for a research study should be based
              on your research goals and the target users of the product you’re
              designing. The best way to check if potential participants meet
              the study’s desired characteristics and represent a diverse set of
              backgrounds is by sending a screener survey. A screener survey is
              a detailed list of questions that help researchers determine if
              potential participants meet the requirements of the research
              study.
            </p>
            <p>
              Screening participants often requires collecting demographics,
              which are the characteristics of a group or individual.
              Demographics that you might ask about in a screener survey
              include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Age</li>
              <li>Geographic location</li>
              <li>Job title or industry</li>
              <li>Gender</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              nterviewing participants with diverse backgrounds, perspectives,
              and abilities is extremely important to ensure that your designs
              are accessible and equitable. As you start thinking about who you
              are designing for, aim to form a representative sample. A
              representative sample is a subset of the target population that
              seeks to accurately reflect the characteristics of the larger
              group.
            </p>
            <p>
              The participants in a representative sample should include user
              groups that have been commonly underrepresented in previous
              research. This lack of representation is often the result of
              biases due to age, race, gender, or ability. Ultimately, the
              research you conduct should help you create great experiences for
              all users.

          <div>
            <h4>Start recruiting participants</h4>
            <p>
              How and where you find research study participants depends on the
              company you work for, the type of product you’re designing, time
              constraints for the research, the project’s budget, and the
              accessibility of target users. Based on these project details, you
              can choose from a variety of ways to find research participants.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Personal network</b></li>
              <li><b>Existing user base</b></li>
              <li><b>Online</b></li>
              <li>
                <b>Hallway testing</b>. If recruiting participants online
                doesn’t seem like an option, a less formal way to recruit for
                your study is to ask people in person. You can use a recruiting
                method known as hallway testing, which means asking people that
                pass by in the “hallway” to try the product you’re designing.
                Try to position yourself in a location where you’re most likely
                to encounter your product’s target audience, like a dog park or
                a coffee shop. Hallway testing can be effective if you’re
                recruiting a small number of participants, if you have limited
                time, or if you want to conduct research for free. However,
                finding participants in this way is risky because the people you
                collect feedback from might not have all the characteristics of
                your product’s potential users.

          <ul>
            <li>Script the interview questions.</li>
            <li>
              Collect supplies you'll need for the interview, such as a printed
              list of your questions, a computer or paper and a pencil, and any
              recording equipment you might need. If you're using new equipment
              or technology during the interview, make sure you know how it
              works in advance.
            </li>
            <li>
              Research the users. If the users you're preparing to interview
              provide their personal information before the interview, be sure
              to take note of it. This information might include their name,
              demographic information, relevant user experience with the product
              you are designing, or details about how they found out about the
              interview. You can also review their answers to a screener survey,
              if you administered one before the interview. Lastly, practice.
            </li>
            <li>
              Practice. It's always a good idea to practice delivering the
              questions you'll ask users before you conduct a real interview.

          <h3>Empathy Maps</h3>
          <p>
            There are many tools a UX designer can use to empathize with users.
            Interviewing users is essential to understanding users’ perspectives
            and learning about their pain points, but that’s only the beginning
            of the UX research process. In this reading, you’ll learn about one
            of the many other tools designers can use to identify user needs:
            empathy maps.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b
              >Remember, empathy maps are easily understood charts that explain
              what UX designers have learned about a particular type of user.
              Empathy maps can help break down each interview into digestible
              pieces of information.</b
            >
          </p>
          <img src="images/empathy-map.svg" alt="" />
          <p>Types of empathy maps:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>One-user empathy maps</b> are created by taking the data from
              one user's interview and turning it into an empathy map, like the
              example earlier in this reading. This approach helps designers
              distill a single user's thoughts, feelings, and traits into a
              format that's easier to gather data from.
            </li>
            <li>
              Aggregated empathy map, represents a group of users who share
              similar thoughts, opinions, or qualities. Aggregated empathy maps
              are created by creating multiple one-user empathy maps, then
              combining the maps where users expressed similar things into a new
              empathy map. This helps designers identify segments, or groups of
              people with similar tendencies, who will use the product. The
              insights in aggregated empathy maps allow designers to identify
              themes, which helps them better empathize with the groups they are
              designing for. To learn more about the different kinds of empathy
              maps, check out this article on empathy mapping

          <h3>Identify user's pain point</h3>
          <p>
            As a UX designer,
            <b
              >empathizing is your number one superpower because it helps you
              spot user problems. Solving user problems is the ultimate goal of
              UX design</b
            >. But how do you even know if a problem is really a problem?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b
              >Pain points are any UX issues that frustrate the user and block
              the user from getting what they need.</b
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            <b
              >UX design is all about the user. You're always, always designing
              for the user</b
            >. But who is the user and what are their struggles?
          </p>
          <p>
            Empathy maps show us what the user thinks, says, does, and feels.
            Empathy maps help us get into the user's mindset, allowing us to
            identify their pain points.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Customer pain points are often grouped into 4 main types</b>:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>productivity</li>
            <li>financial</li>

        <div>
          <h3>Understand personas</h3>
          <p>
            In UX design,
            <b
              >personas are fictional users whose goals and characteristics
              represent the needs of a larger group of users. Personas can help
              us identify patterns of behavior in users. These patterns might
              point to a common pain point that a group of users experiences</b
            >.
            <i
              >While personas are fictional, we don't make these characters up
              from scratch, we build them based on research</i
            >. You've got to do your research if you want a set of personas that
            truly represent your potential users. As you research, you'll form
            images in your head about who your users are. These will become your
            personas.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will <b>build a persona to represent each key user group</b>,
            and that will take time. It's worth it to build so many personas.
          </p>
          <p>
            You need a set of personas. All user groups should be vividly
            represented. This shows
            <span title="заинтересованные стороны">stakeholders</span> the
            diversity of their user groups, and it lets you test features
            against them. This leads us to the third reason for why personas are
            worth it. Personas stress-test designs.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Building personas</h3>
          <p>
            Personas are created by conducting user research and identifying
            common pain points, which are UX issues that frustrate and block the
            user from getting what they need from a product.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you create personas, look for the most common themes in your data
            and group the users who personify those themes together. Generally,
            creating 3 to 8 personas is enough to represent the majority of a
            product’s user base. Think of personas as an overview of all of your
            research and interviews. While it’s important for personas to
            accurately represent users, it’s impossible to meet every one of
            their specific needs. Personas are also context-specific, meaning
            they should be focused on the behaviors and goals of users
            interacting with the product effectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pro tip: Get your team's opinion on the product’s users before you
            build personas. Then, after you build personas, review those
            suggestions from your team and compare them to the personas you
            created. Point out how the data validated or contradicted their
            suggestions. Everyone on your team needs to understand the personas
            in order to truly connect with your users.

          <h3>Learn more about user stories</h3>
          <p>
            You’ve already learned about empathy maps and personas and how they
            can help you empathize with the users you’re designing for. Another
            helpful way to understand your users is to build a user story around
            their experiences with your product. A
            <b
              >user story is a fictional one-sentence story told from the
              persona’s point of view to inspire and inform design decisions</b
            >. This is a great opportunity to use your imagination as you create
            the stories that capture the needs of your users. User stories
            should be written in the following format:
          </p>
          <img src="images/learn-more-about-user-story.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            As a <b>type of user (who)</b>, I <b>want to action (what)</b> so
            that <b>benefit (why)</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using this format is a clear way to ensure your user story is
            communicating everything you need to know about the persona. The
            user stories you create will be very valuable as you start designing
            your product. User stories can also serve as a “checklist” to make
            sure you’re addressing and solving the key problems your users might
            face when engaging with your product.
          </p>
          <p>
            Different users have different needs, so be sure to practice empathy
            and keep their unique needs in mind when writing user stories. To
            help you write the most effective user stories, check out this

          <p>
            Personas and user stories represent the needs of the users you’re
            designing for. The more detailed and accurate your personas and user
            stories are, the better you will be at designing products that meet
            their needs.

            When building a new or improved product, the
            <b>designer's goal is to keep all users on the happy path</b>. The
            happy path describes a user story with a happy ending.

              their goal without issue</b

          </p>
          <p>
            <b
              >An edge case is a rare situation or unexpected problem that

            UX design pro tips for spotting and resolving potential edge cases
            before the product launches, so other users don't end up in Iyla's
            situation:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Create personas and user stories</b>. If UX designers make sure
              their personas and user stories account for a wide variety of
              users and problems, they can keep even the most vulnerable users
              on the happy path.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Thoroughly review the project before launch</b>. In the rush to
              launch a product, UX designers might focus only on the happy path.
              Giving the project a final good review from the user's
              perspective, helps designers identify edge cases.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Use wireframes</b>. Wireframes help visualize the project,
              which makes it easier to identify potential user pain points and
              fix them before launch for folks who are not visually impaired.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Create a user journey map</h3>
          <p>
            <b
              >A user journey is the series of experiences a user has as they
              achieve a specific goal</b
            >. User journeys built off the personas and stories you've already
            created.
            <i
              >They help you think and feel like the user, which is super
              important. If you can't put yourself in the user's shoes, you
              can't be sure your design will really help them</i
            >. Before you start the user journey, you need a journey map.
            <b
              >A journey map is just what it sounds like, an illustration of
              what the user goes through to achieve their goals</b
            >.
          </p>
          <p>A user journey map helps UX designers:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>create obstacle-free paths for users</li>
            <li>
              reduces the impact of designer bias, which you might remember as
              the tendency for the designer to design according to their own
              needs and wants instead of the users
            </li>
            <li>
              lets you thoroughly document the entire sequence of events and
              interactions a user experiences, including the user's interaction
              with your design. You can really focus on how a specific persona,
              not you, thinks and feels at every step of the journey
            </li>
            <li>highlights new pain points</li>

          <h3>Consider accessibility when empathizing</h3>
          <p>
            <b
              >Accessibility is the design of products, devices, services, or
              environments for people with disabilities</b
            >. Designing for accessibility is about considering all users’
            journeys, keeping their permanent, temporary, or situational
            disabilities in mind. By researching how people with disabilities
            interact with products like yours, you can better understand how to
            design for them. It’s not possible to accurately guess all the ways
            that a user might experience your product, which is one reason why
            including people with disabilities in your research is so important.
          </p>
          <div>
            <h4>Assistive technologies</h4>
            <p>
              Creating a product design that takes every range of ability into
              account can be incredibly difficult. Thankfully, there are
              services and apps designed to help bridge the gap. For example,
              one service that’s recently been added by phone providers is
              Real-Time Texting, which lets users text during a phone call to
              improve communication.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another feature that helps people with disabilities is alternative
              text. People who have low vision or are blind often rely on screen
              readers to read the content on their screens aloud. But, if your
              informational icons don’t have labels or alternative text, the
              screen reader can’t describe the functionality of that button to
              the user. Not every image or icon is informational, so only
              include descriptions when necessary.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              Why is it important to consider someone with a disability when
              creating personas, user stories, and user journeys? Select all
              that apply.
            </p>
            <p>
              <i
                >To meet diversity and accessibility expectations -
                <b
                  >this should not be selected Considering diversity and
                  accessibility is a part of creating design solutions; it isn’t
                  to meet expectations</b
                >. All people should have access to the same human rights. When
                designing, it’s important to remember that people with and
                without disabilities share the same goal for any given user
                problem that a design solution is trying to solve</i
              >.

            <h4>Putting inclusive design into practice</h4>
            <p>
              To put inclusive design into practice, it’s important to immerse
              yourself in the assistive technology that people with disabilities
              might use and to have conversations with them about their
              experiences. The best way to design empathetically for the world
              around you is to engage with your users and ask them questions
              about the way your designs could help them succeed.
            </p>

        <h2>Define problem and hypothesis statements</h2>
        <p>
          <b
            >A problem statement is a clear description of the user's needs that
            should be addressed</b

          <i
            >Problem statements align the team on which user problem to focus
            on, giving everyone a clear goal</i
          >. <b>A strong problem statement is human-centered</b>. It should be
          broad enough to allow for some creative freedom, but narrow enough
          that it can actually be solved by a design solution. Problem
          statements can be written using a simple formula:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Start with the name of the user.</li>
          <li>Add a short description of the user's characteristics.</li>
          <li>
            Clearly describe the user's need and explain why the user has that
            need.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>What can we learn from an effective problem statement?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            problem statements <b>help us establish goals</b>. An effective
            problem statement tells you what the user really needs. Defining the
            goal clearly and concisely gets everyone on the design team onboard
            and focused on the same thing.

          <h3>The connection between pain points and problem statements</h3>
          <p>
            As a reminder,
            <b
              >pain points are any UX issue or friction that frustrates the user
              and blocks them from getting what they need</b
            >. Minimizing pain points keeps users happy and encourages them to
            keep interacting with the product.

          <h3>The 5 Ws and H: who, what, when, where, why, and how</h3>
          <p>
            The most common framework used to create problem statements is the 5
            Ws and H framework. After you define the user’s pain points, you can
            answer who, what, when, where, why, and how to solve the user’s
            problem.
          </p>
          <img src="images/who-when-why.png" alt="" />
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Who is experiencing the problem?</b> Knowing your users and
              their background is key to creating successful solutions for them.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>What are the pain points you’re trying to solve?</b>
              Determining a user’s pain points early allows you to answer the
              rest of these questions and clarify the context of the pain
              points.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Where is the user when they’re using the product?</b> A user’s
              physical context matters to your design.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>When does the problem occur?</b> Maybe it’s right after the end
              of a long and tedious process, or maybe it’s something that
              happens daily. Knowing when the problem occurs can help you better
              empathize with the user’s feelings.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Why is the problem important?</b> Knowing how this problem
              affects your user’s experience and life will help to clarify the
              potential consequences.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>How are users reaching their goals by using the product?</b>
              Understanding how users reach their goals allows you to map the
              user journey that they take through your product.
            </li>

            <i
              >Problem statements provide clarity about your users’ goals and
              help UX designers identify constraints that prevent users from
              meeting those goals. Problem statements also help your team

            <li>
              <b

              you can discover and understand users' likes, dislikes, and pain
              points.
            </li>
            <li>
              Then, sort through research you collected about users to
              <b
                >define the problem they're facing. Creating a problem statement
                helps you clearly define the user pain points that your future

              >.
            </li>
            <li>
              Now, you can begin coming up with solutions that address those
              problems! You’re ready to create hypothesis statements.
              <b
                >A hypothesis statement is an educated guess about what you
                think the solution to a design problem might be. You know the
                challenges users are facing, so it’s time to consider how your
                designs can alleviate their pain points</b
              >.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Hypothesis statements don’t have a single standard formula to
            follow, but there are two common methods you can try using to write
            one:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              you can use the

            </li>
            <li>

            You might encounter situations where you have multiple hypothesis
            statements for one problem statement. That’s okay! There will always
            be multiple solutions for the problems that users are facing. Your
            job as a UX designer is to use your creativity and problem-solving
            skills to decide which solutions work best for the unique users
            you’re designing for.

          <h3>Determine a value proposition</h3>
          <p>
            Time to think about what your users need, it's important to start
            thinking about how your product meets those needs. This is known as
            a value proposition.
            <b
              >A value roposition is the reason why a consumer should use a
              product or a service</b
            >. You can think of this statement as the reason users will be
            interested and willing to engage with your product.
            <i
              >Value propositions ensure that users have a reason to use the
              product that you are creating, as opposed to any other product
              currently available</i
            >. As you think about the value proposition for your first project,
            your first step should be to answer these two important questions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>What does your product do?</li>
            <li>And why should the user care?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            One of the
            <b
              >most important things to know about value propositions is that
              they need to be short, clear, and to the point</b
            >. Users want to be able to easily identify exactly how your product
            will meet their unique needs and what sets your product apart in the
            market.
            <i
              >Sometimes users won’t know what they need until you explain it to
              them</i

          <h3>Learn more about design ideation</h3>
          <p>
            design ideation is the process of generating a broad set of ideas on
            a given topic without judging or evaluating them. When you start
            thinking of ideas, you want to come up with as many as possible. The
            aim is to generate lots of ideas, even ones that may seem ridiculous
            at first.
          </p>
          <h4>Preparing for ideation</h4>
          <ul>

              <img src="images/empathize-with-user.png" alt="" />
              <b>Empathize with your user</b>. Empathizing is the first step in
              the design process. You need to know who you’re solving for and
              what their needs are. You empathized with your user already by
              creating empathy maps, personas, user stories, and user journey
              maps.
            </li>
            <li>
              <img src="images/define-problem.png" alt="" />
              <b>Define the problem</b>. Defining is the second step in the
              design process. The problem you’re trying to solve should be
              well-defined, so that everyone on your team can think of ideas to
              solve the same problem. Knowing exactly what problem you need to
              solve will also keep your users’ needs top-of-mind.

              <img src="images/esteblish-creative-inviroment.png" alt="" />
              <b>Establish a creative environment</b>. You’ll need a comfortable
              space where everyone on your team can get together and present
              their ideas. If you’re meeting in person, choose an ideation space
              that’s different from your usual workspace. If you’re ideating
              virtually, try to find a different space in your home that’s free
              of clutter and distractions.

              <img src="images/set-time-limit.png" alt="" />
              <b>Set a time limit</b>. There are an endless number of possible
              products and features you could design, so give yourself plenty of
              time to come up with ideas. However, you can’t brainstorm forever,
              so you’ll also need to set a time to stop brainstorming and start
              thinking more deeply about the ideas you’ve come up with.
            </li>
            <li>
              <img src="images/assemble-diverse-team.png" alt="" />
              <b>Assemble a diverse team</b>. You’re trying to come up with as
              many different ideas as possible. An inclusive team of people,
              with different races, genders, abilities, and backgrounds, will
              help you come up with all kinds of solutions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <img src="images/think-outside-box.png" alt="" />
              <b>Think outside the box</b>. Don’t limit yourself to traditional
              ideas and solutions. If you have a cool idea that seems a little
              different, write it down! Think big and get creative while
              ideating.
            </li>

              them</b
            >. The broad set of ideas part is really important. Ideation is all
            about coming up with lots and lots of ideas. The no judgment part is
            important too.

              <b>voice</b> - UX designers often work closely with marketing and
              branding teams. That's because branding has a big effect on how
              users experience a product. Two major components of branding are
              voice and the tone. Even though a brand isn't a human being, it
              still has a personality. Users don't want to communicate with a
              brand that uses robotic sounding language. Instead, users want to
              interact with the brand whose voice and tone sounds human and
              engaging. Here's the thing: Voice and tone have a huge impact on a
              user's experience with a product.

          <p>
            Competitive audits are one of the many valuable steps you can take
            during the ideation process.
            <b
              >A competitive audit is an overview of your competitors’ strengths
              and weaknesses</b

            <i
              >Analyzing the brands and products of competitors, or the
              companies who offer similar products as you do, can give you a
              well-rounded foundation of knowledge about the market your product
              will enter. That knowledge will carry into your designs and help
              you create a product that’s helpful and unique for users</i
            >. As a UX designer, you’ll likely partner with folks from other
            teams, like marketing or product management, to run a competitive
            audit.

            Your competition falls into two categories: direct and indirect.
            Examining both of these competitors can offer insights about the
            path your designs might take and the users that you’re designing
            for.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Direct competitors</b> are companies that have offerings
              similar to your product and focus on the same audience.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Indirect competitors</b> can have a similar set of offerings
              and a different audience, or a different set of offerings with the
              same audience.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <div>
            <h4>Why are competitive audits important?</h4>
            <p>
              Consider how much work your direct and indirect competitors have
              already done to design and market their products to users. They’ve
              already had an impact on the industry that your product will
              enter. Studying these companies, their designs, and their user
              feedback is a fantastic source of information.
            </p>
            <p>
              Competitive audits can offer many benefits throughout your
              ideation phase, including:

            <ul>
              <li>
                Giving you an idea of products already in the market and their

            <h3>Limitations of competitive audit</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Stifle creativity. If you spend too much time focusing on what
                others are doing, you might prevent yourself from creating a
                truly innovative product. Innovation doesn't happen by copying
                the competition. The key is to understand what the competition
                is doing and use that as a starting point to push forward and
                innovate.
              </li>
              <li>
                Success of the competitive audit depends on how well you
                interpret the findings. Analyzing data can be tricky, and it's a
                skill that you'll develop throughout your career as a designer.
                Working on a team can be helpful here as you'll have others to
                interpret the data with.
              </li>
              <li>
                Not all designs work in all use cases. The features that work
                well for a competitor might not work well for your product, if
                you serve different users.
              </li>

                problem you’re trying to address. During a HMW exercise, you’d
                create a list of questions that start with “How might we” and
                use those to spark ideas for solutions.

                  >To create good HMW questions, you need a well-defined problem
                  statement</b
                >. From there, you can reframe this problem statement into
                questions that will help you come up with ideas to solve the
                problem.

              <p>Frame HMW questions</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Amp up the good</li>
                <li>Explore the opposite</li>
                <li>Change a status quo</li>
                <li>Break the point of view into pieces</li>

                <li>Go after the adjective</li>
                <li>
                  Question an <span title="предположение">assumption</span>
                </li>
                <li>Create an analogy using the esteblished need of context</li>
                <li>
                  Identify unexpected resoureces that can provide assistance
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Best practices for thinking of HMWs:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Be broad. A good HMW should allow for multiple solutions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  But don’t be too broad. You want your HMWs to be
                  comprehensive, but narrow enough to keep your solutions
                  focused.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Make multiple drafts. It’s okay to change your HMW questions
                  after you’ve written them. If you find that your HMW doesn’t
                  help you think of any useful solutions, change it up!
                </li>
                <li>
                  Be creative. HMWs are meant to be imaginative and even fun.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Write as many HMWs as you can. The more HMWs you have, the
                  more solutions you can come up with.
                </li>

                <b
                  >Crazy Eights is a great way to get ideas flowing for any
                  design problem you need to solve.</b
                >
                With Crazy Eights, you’ll sketch eight different designs, each
                with a new idea for solving the user’s problem.

              <h4>Best practices</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Do a creative warm-up exercise</b>. Complete an activity where you
                  draw the person next to you without looking at your paper, or
                  have everyone draw their own interpretation of a word or
                  phrase.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Make sure your problem is well defined</b>. Develop a set of Crazy
                  Eights for one How might we question or one problem statement
                  at a time.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Don’t judge your ideas</b>. Ideating is all about creating lots of
                  ideas, not creating perfect ones!
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Don’t judge other people’s ideas</b>. Keep an open mind when other
                  people are presenting their sketches.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Include a diverse group</b>. Since Crazy Eights are often done in
                  a group setting, it’s best that your group represents a
                  variety of work roles, experiences, abilities, genders, and
                  backgrounds. This will help your team have a wide range of
                  ideas to choose from.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Ideate in a comfortable environment</b>. Do this exercise in a
                  location that’s relaxed and encourages creative thinking.
                </li>
                <li><b>Don’t be afraid of sketching</b>. You don’t have to be an artist to be a UX designer, and your sketches during Crazy Eights don’t have to be perfect. You just need to clearly communicate your ideas.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><b>Crazy Eights is an exciting design ideation exercise that generates a lot of ideas in a small amount of time.</b> If you have five people do the exercise at the same time, you’ll have 40 potential solutions after only eight minutes. <b>Crazy Eights also forces you to think outside the box because you have to come up with many ideas in a short timeframe, without judging them. This means that you will have lots of unique, nontraditional solutions to consider</b>.</p>

          <h4>Additional research</h4>
          <p><b>New blockers may come up during the ideation phase. If they do, designers should consider if further research and data collection is needed. In order to create a product that addresses user needs and wants, designers may need more information in order to resolve them.</b></p>
