              In this course, you’ll continue to design a mobile app, in
              alignment with the project prompt from Sharpen that you selected
              earlier in the program. You've made your way through the
              empathize, define, ideate, and prototype phases of the design
              process for your app designs. Now, you're ready for the test
              phase, which is what this course is all about. You will learn how
              to plan and conduct a usability study to test your designs with
              users and gather feedback. Then, you'll modify your designs based
              on insights from your research.

            <p>There are four steps in a UX research study.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The first step is to <b>plan the study</b>. To plan a study,
                start by outlining the background for the project. Next, set
                goals for your research, and write down the questions you want
                to answer. Then establish the steps you'll take to conduct the
                study and select the people who will participate in the study.
                The work you do while planning the research study is incredibly
                important since it impacts every other part of your research.
                You need a proper plan to get successful research results.
              </li>
              <li>
                The second step is to <b>conduct the research</b>. During this
                step, you'll gather data. There are several techniques you can
                use, but the one we'll focus on in this course is called a
                usability study. A usability study is a research method that
                assesses how easy it is for users to complete core tasks in a
                design. The goal of usability study is to identify pain points
                that the user experiences with your designs so the issues can be
                fixed before the final product launches. During a usability
                study, you get a chance to see how users interact with your new
                product or feature. You can also interview users to learn more
                about their experience.
              </li>
              <li>
                The third step is to <b>analyze and synthesize your results</b>.
                This involves trying to find the actual meaning in the data. You
                want to figure out why the data is the way it is. Look for
                patterns in the quantitative data and explore trends in the
                qualitative data from participants' answers to interview
                questions.
              </li>
              <li>
                The last step is to
                <b
                  >share and promote your insights with the project's
                  stakeholders</b
                >. Project stakeholders are people who are involved in the
                project or who will be impacted by its results. Project
                stakeholders need the results of your research and need to agree
                with the direction of the project. For example, your project
                stakeholders might include other designers, the head of your
                department, or the engineers who will help bring your design to
                life. To share and promote your insights, you need to create a
                presentation. Your presentation should include the method you
                use to conduct your research, the data you collected, the
                conclusions you reached based on that data, and your
                recommendations for acting on those conclusions. The stronger
                the connection between your research conclusions and your
                recommendations, the more likely it is that your stakeholders
                will take the actions you've proposed. Why is conducting a UX
                research study important?

                >The goal of user experience research is to prioritize the user.
                A UX research study helps us gain an understanding of users'
                problems in order to solve them. It can also help bridge the gap
                between what a business thinks the user needs and what the user
                actually needs before an expensive and time-consuming product is
                made.</b

            <h3>Language and communication in UX research</h3>
            <img
              src="images/best practices-for-communication-in-UX-research.png"
              alt=""

            <ul>
              <li>
                <h4>Language and communication matter.</h4>
                <p>
                  When it comes to UX research, written and spoken language play
                  a very important role in the success of your product and the
                  feedback you receive about your designs. Language is the
                  primary tool you’ll use for collecting data, building
                  relationships with research study participants, reporting
                  research findings to your team, and representing the users
                  you’re designing for.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <i
                    >The language you use while conducting research directly
                    affects the language your participants use</i
                  >. Your understanding of the best language to use in any given
                  situation will continually shift as you learn the ins and outs
                  of conducting UX research. Using appropriate language while
                  conducting research is an ongoing process!
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Consider word choices</h4>
                <p>
                  When conducting research, it’s important that you understand
                  your own ideas on language use, as well as the ideas other
                  communities have about language. This way, you can better
                  identify and avoid your own biases about language use. All
                  languages are important and complex, and they deserve to be
                  represented equally.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Keep in mind that some languages and language varieties
                  express the same concepts in different ways. As the UX
                  designer conducting research, it’s your responsibility to seek
                  clarification on language differences and to ensure the
                  translations of participants’ insights are accurate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <i
                    >There’s no right or wrong way to communicate an idea, but
                    language often reveals hidden power imbalances. When
                    conducting research, you want to make sure you’re
                    communicating in a way that’s inviting, not commanding. For
                    example, avoid using words that are considered ableist, or
                    words that assume a person does not have a disability.</i
                  >
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b
                    >Overall, your goal when conducting research is to make
                    participants feel welcomed and valued for who they are.</b
                  >
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Keep the context in mind</h4>
                <p>
                  You also need to consider the context that the research is
                  happening in, such as the physical space where the research
                  study is taking place. You want participants to feel like
                  there’s an equal power dynamic between them and you as the
                  researcher. For example, if one person is sitting and the
                  other person is standing, there’s an unequal power dynamic and
                  the situation can feel awkward or off putting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some portions of your research studies might need to be
                  adjusted to meet participants where they are. Different
                  communities have different ways of interacting with others in
                  various situations, so it’s important to be aware of those
                  cultural differences. For example, some cultural groups take
                  turns when speaking, while others feel free to interrupt
                  whenever they have a great idea. In other words, one research
                  study participant might consider interrupting to be rude,
                  while another might think that interrupting shows engagement
                  in the conversation. In your role as a researcher, you need to
                  be aware of context changes and pay close attention to how
                  participants prefer to communicate to create an equitable
                  environment for all participants.

            <h3>UX Research Plan</h3>
            <p>There are seven elements that your plan should include:</p>
            <img
              src="images/elements-ux-research-plan.jpeg"
              alt="elements of ux-research plan"

            <ul>
              <li>
                <h4>Project background.</h4>
                <p>
                  The project background answers the question: What led you to
                  conduct this research? You don't have to provide a long drawn
                  out history, just a few lines is good. You might explain the
                  project background like this: We're creating a new app to help
                  people find and schedule dog walkers. We need to find out if
                  the main user experience, finding and scheduling a dog walker,
                  is easy for users to complete.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b
                    >This element summarizes the situation leading to the needs
                    for this research. It's a brief explanation you can give to
                    anyone who asks why you're doing this research.</b
                  >
                </p>
                <p>
                  <i
                    >It’s important to identify signals that indicate why the
                    research is necessary. Why is the research being conducted?
                    What problems is the design trying to solve? If there is no
                    user problem, people may not understand the project’s
                    necessity.</i
                  >
                </p>
                <p>
                  A clear project background also shows you understand why
                  you're doing this research and promotes confidence in the
                  overall quality of your analysis and insights. The value of
                  this might not be apparent when you're planning your study,
                  but it will be when you present your research to people who
                  have the power to act on your recommendations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Now that you know why the project background is an important
                  part of a research plan, you're ready to create your own. Keep
                  these three things in mind, as you write the project
                  background:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Identify the signals that indicated research was necessary.
                    Ask yourself why you're doing this research and if there's a
                    problem you're trying to solve.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Describe any previous research that has been conducted or
                    solutions that have been tried. How have previous attempts
                    brought us closer to solving the problem?
                  </li>

                    insights will be used and what decisions will be made based
                    on those insights. There might be a lot of information, but
                    keep the project background
                    <span title="краткий">concise</span> so that everyone on
                    your team will read it.

                  What design problems are you trying to solve? And how will the
                  results of the research impact our design decisions? Use your
                  answers to create goals for your research project. In our
                  example, one research goal might be: determine if the dog
                  walker app is difficult to use. We need to consider the ease
                  of use in order to understand why customers join our app and
                  leave or stay.

                  Finally, if you run research on a product after it has been
                  launched, your research goals help you understand if the
                  product worked as expected. This type of research is called
                  post-launch research, and the goals reflect whether you have
                  successfully completed what you set out to do.

                <h3>Develop detailed research questions for your plan</h3>
                <p>
                  What are the questions your research is trying to answer? For
                  example, our research questions might be, how long does it
                  take a user to find and book a dog walker in the app? And what
                  can we learn from the user flow or the steps that users take
                  to book a dog walker?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Why are research questions important? They guide your
                  research. Research questions provide focus and structure for
                  your research study. In addition, research questions will be
                  the main topics you cover in your presentation. A few quick
                  tips for writing research questions:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <i>A good research question should be actionable</i>. You
                    should be able to identify a clear way to attempt to answer
                    the question.

                    Make sure your research questions are specific and not too
                    broad. You want to answer specific questions and produce
                    meaningful data.

                  <li>
                    And make sure your research questions aren't leading.
                    Questions should be neutrally phrased so that they don't
                    sound like you're assuming a particular answer to your
                    question.

                <h3>Key performance indicators, or KPIs</h3>
                <p>
                  Any time you conduct research, you want to have a way to
                  measure the effectiveness of your product or prototype. To do
                  so, use key performance indicators (KPIs), which are critical
                  measures of progress toward an end goal.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a reminder, key performance indicators are critical
                  measures of progress toward an end goal. You might ask, how
                  can you measure your progress toward the research goal? For
                  our app, one thing we should track is how many users in the
                  research study complete their search for a dog walker. So the
                  KPI would be the percentage of users who book a dog walker.

                  <li>
                    <b>Time on task</b> measures how long it takes for a user to
                    complete a task. A task can involve any function within the
                    product you’re designing, such as filling out a form or
                    making a purchase. To measure time on task, all you need is
                    a timer! Start timing the user when they begin the task
                    you’ve assigned, and stop timing as soon as they completed
                    the task.

                  <li>
                    <b>Use of navigation vs. search</b> indicates the number of
                    people who use a website or an app’s navigation, compared to
                    the number of people who use the search functionality. In
                    other words, some users will prefer to use the navigation
                    bar to get around your product, while others will go
                    straight to the search bar, type in a query, and be directed
                    to part of the product.

                  <li>
                    <b>User error rates</b> indicate the parts of a design that
                    cause users to make errors. For example, a user might click
                    on the wrong icon when trying to make a purchase, forget to
                    check a box, or submit incorrect information when filling
                    out a form. These errors are not the user’s fault! Instead,
                    user error rates help point to areas where you need to make
                    improvements to the design of the user experience.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Drop-off rates</b> show how many users abandon the
                    experience. In other words, this KPI reveals how many users
                    quit before reaching the end of a purchase or some other
                    endpoint you’re trying to lead them to. Users might quit
                    using your product if the navigation is difficult to
                    understand, if they get frustrated while trying to complete
                    a task, or if they simply get bored.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Conversion rates</b> measure the percentage of users who
                    complete a desired action. Conversion rates are the opposite
                    of drop-off rates. Any time a user successfully completes a
                    task, meets a goal, or makes it to the final destination of
                    your product, it’s a conversion. Think of the dog walker app
                    as an example: The user needs to take multiple steps to find
                    and reserve a dog walker. The conversion rate will show the
                    percentage of users that actually made it to the end of the
                    flow and booked a reservation.

                  <li>
                    <b>A System Usability Scale (SUS)</b> is a questionnaire
                    that asks participants their opinions about your product;
                    the results are used to measure the usability of your
                    designs. In an SUS, users are asked the extent to which they
                    agree or disagree with 10 statements about the usability of
                    a design. For example, users might be asked to respond to
                    the statement: “I thought the app was easy to use” on a
                    scale from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree.” It’s a
                    quick and reliable way to know if a design is working.

                    <b>The Net Promoter Score (NPS) </b> is a measure of how
                    loyal users will be to your product or service. The NPS
                    measures the likelihood that a user would recommend your
                    product to a friend or colleague. Participants rate the
                    question, “Would you recommend this product to a friend or
                    colleague?” on a scale of 0 to 10. Promoters are
                    participants who give a rating of 9 or 10, which means they
                    would recommend your product to others. Passives are
                    participants who give a rating of 7 or 8, which means they
                    are satisfied with your product, but they probably won’t
                    pass it along to friends or colleagues. Detractors are
                    participants who rate from 0 to 6, which means they could
                    warn people away from your product or service.

                <h3>Participants</h3>
                <p>
                  As you develop your UX research plan, you’ll outline a group
                  of participants to include in the study and collect feedback
                  from. The participants in your study should represent your
                  product’s potential users. These participants play a big role
                  in shaping your designs because you’ll take their pain points
                  and suggestions into account as you iterate.

                  To find out if users are able to find and schedule a dog
                  walker in our new app, we might want to conduct a survey of
                  prospective users. To analyze the survey results, we will use
                  a spreadsheet and identify trends. In addition, your research
                  plan lists the research participants. Who will you survey?
                  What characteristics do the participants have? For example,
                  you might want to recruit participants who are dog owners with
                  full-time jobs and who go out for activities more than once a
                  week. The types of participants you select should be based on
                  your research goals. Also, make sure that participants you
                  select do not bias your results.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Usability study benefit from recruiting participants with
                  diverse abilities because learning how someone with specific
                  needs might use a product a usability study can identify how
                  someone with specific needs and abilities might use a product.
                  This is a crucial part of the UX research and design process
                  because it also supports making products accessible to a wide
                  range of users.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Your research plan should include a list of the primary
                  characteristics of the people you will recruit to participate
                  in the study. The types of participants you select should be
                  based on your research goals and the target users of the
                  product you’re designing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The best way to check if potential participants meet your
                  desired characteristics and represent a diverse set of
                  individuals is with a screener survey. A screener survey is a
                  detailed list of questions that help you determine whether
                  potential participants meet the requirements of the research
                  study.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As you create a screener survey, remember that getting
                  feedback from participants with diverse backgrounds,
                  perspectives, and abilities is extremely important for
                  ensuring that your designs are accessible and equitable. A
                  representative sample is a small group of participants who
                  represent both your target user group and user groups that are
                  often marginalized. And a marginalized population is one where
                  people have specific characteristics and life experiences that
                  prevent them from fitting into what society inaccurately
                  defines as “normal,” such as people with disabilities or
                  people with limited access to technology. Collecting feedback
                  from a representative sample will help you enrich the overall
                  user experience on your product.

                  In an effort to be inclusive of people of all abilities when
                  you’re recruiting participants for your usability study, your
                  first instinct might be to seek out people based on their
                  disability status. But directly asking someone’s disability
                  status limits people to only one aspect of their identity:
                  their disability. Disability status can be considered
                  Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information, which is
                  illegal to inquire about in many situations. Instead of
                  recruiting participants who are visually impaired, hearing
                  impaired, or who have physical impairments, recruit
                  participants who use the assistive technologies you want to
                  involve in your study. For example, seek out participants who
                  use:
                </p>

                    refer to accessibility. It’s shorthand for representing the
                    11 letters between the letter “a” and the letter “y” in the
                    word “accessibility.” More importantly, a11y resembles the
                    word “ally,” which reflects the idea that UX designers need
                    to be allies to people with all types of abilities.</b

            <h3>Respect user data and privacy</h3>
            <p>
              For ethical reasons, when conducting research we should always act
              with integrity, and that includes protecting users' privacy.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                One reason is privacy laws and ethics. If you don't maintain
                your users' privacy, you could be violating the law.
              </li>
              <li>
                Risk of hacking. You need to secure sensitive data to avoid
                getting hacked and risk hackers sharing users' data without
                their consent.
              </li>
              <li>
                privacy and data security is important is for protecting your
                company's brand. In other words, this is about ensuring that
                your users perceive your brand positively based on their
                experience with you. By emphasizing data protection, you gain
                their trust. And even though your research participants aren't
                necessarily customers, their perceptions about you and your
                company matter.

                personally identifiable information, or PII. This is made up of
                specific details that could be used to identify a user. This
                includes names, home addresses, email addresses, and phone
                numbers.
              </li>
              <li>
                sensitive personally identificòable information, or SPII, and
                it's even more critical. SPII is data that, if lost,
                compromised, or stolen could cause your users financial harm or
                embarrassment, or potentially lead to their being discriminated
                against. This includes social security numbers, driver's license
                numbers, passport numbers, financial account numbers, date of
                birth, race, disability status, gender, sexuality, criminal

          <h2>Conducting research with usability studies</h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              <b
                >Usability studies are a research method that assesses how easy
                it is for participants to complete core tasks in a design.</b
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              During a usability study, researchers follow participants as they
              interact with the product. The user's feedback helps the design
              team make important improvements to the user experience. Usability
              studies can take place at various points in the design process.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can conduct a usability study when you have an early idea,
              like a lo-fi prototype that is only somewhat interactive. Often
              this is called concept testing. You can also conduct a usability
              study when you have an interactive prototype. This is the most
              common time to conduct the study because it gives the design team
              insight on what needs to be revised or added before the product
              launches. You can even conduct the usability study with a product
              that is complete. You may want to change a feature of the product
              or test if the product is usable with a specific group of people.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>
                While the user feedback might not all be positive, it will
                always make the product better.</b
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              There are two types of usability studies: moderated and
              unmoderated.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Moderated usability studies</b> have a person, known as a
              moderator, guide participants through the study in real time.
              Because a person facilitates the session, moderated usability
              studies allow for rapport building between the moderator and
              participant, which can help the participant open up and share more
              feedback about the design. Moderated studies work best when you
              want to dig into the details because you can ask follow-up
              questions throughout the session to learn more.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Unmoderated usability studies</b> have participants test the
              prototypes without human guidance. Participants move through the
              study at their own pace and often in their own environment.
              Usually, the study is recorded on video, and the UX team reviews
              the video footage after the study. Unmoderated studies can be
              advantageous because they more closely simulate how a user would
              interact with the product in the real world.

            <h3>Usability study best practices</h3>
            <p>
              A usability study is at its best when participants come from
              diverse backgrounds and have varying abilities. The unique life
              experiences, perspectives, identities, and abilities of
              participants will inform the feedback they provide about your
              designs. Your goal is to create designs that work for all types of
              users, so learning from a diverse pool of research participants is
              key
            </p>

              src="images/best practices-for-communication-in-UX-research.png"

          <div>
            <h3>Reducing biases when interviewing participants</h3>
            <p>
              Biases that might occur when you moderate usability studies.
              Remember, a bias is favoring or having prejudice based on limited
              information. It's important to call out that all humans are
              susceptible to bias.
            </p>
            <p>
              The key is to identify and become aware of these biases so that
              you can guard against them. Identifying your own personal biases
              can be challenging, because biases usually unconscious, a lot of
              times we don't even realize we're experiencing it. But if you know
              what biases you have, you can take steps to minimize their
              effects.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Implicit bias or unconscious bias</b>, is the collection of
                attitudes and stereotypes we associate to people without our
                conscious knowledge. These attitudes and stereotypes are often
                negative, exclusionary, or disempowering. When recruiting
                participants for usability studies, any implicit biases you have
                against a particular user group might impact your expectations
                for how those participants will interact with the product.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Serial position effect</b>, is a psychological bias that
                states that when given a list of items, people are more likely
                to remember the first few and the last few while the items in
                the middle tend to blur.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Friendliness bias</b> describes the tendency of people to
                agree with those they like in order to maintain a
                nonconfrontational conversation. If you are too friendly and
                develop too strong a rapport with participants, there's a chance
                participants will want to agree with you in order to avoid
                confrontation. This can stop participants from giving honest
                feedback. Your goal is to improve the product's design. So
                remind participants that you actually need honest feedback in
                order to improve the product.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Social desirability bias</b> is a tendency for people to
                answer questions in a way that will be viewed favorably by
                others

                Traditional research focuses on defining trends in the

            <p>
              When you synthesize something, you combine ideas to draw
              conclusions. What does that mean for us? Well, when UX designers
              synthesize research, we group data into themes. We want to find
              <span title="идеи">insights</span> that evolve our understanding
              of users and their needs. That last part is really key. A
              <span title="синтез развивает наше понимание"
                >synthesis evolves our understanding</span
              >. For example, remember how 4 of the 5 participants in our
              usability study said they want to be able to book a dog walker
              repeatedly? By grouping these shared frustrations, we can
              understand how crucial this problem is and figure out ways to
              solve it -- this is our insight.
            </p>
            <p>
              After we discover insights, we're ready to iterate on our design.
              Iterate means we revise the original design to create a new and
              improved version. UX design is all about coming up with an idea,
              getting feedback from participants or users, and iterating to make
              the idea better.
            </p>
            <p>
              You've carefully planned your UX research study and conducted the
              research with a participant. You're ready to turn your
              observations from the research into actionable insights.
            </p>
            <p>
              let's review what an insight is in the field of UX design. You
              might remember that an insight is an observation about people that
              helps you understand the user or their needs from a new
              perspective. Insights can help us figure out how different pieces
              of data relate to each other. Insights also help explain what data
              means and what to do with it. How can we come up with a list of
              insights? I'm glad you asked. In just four steps, we can turn the
              observations from our research into actionable insights.

                <h3>Gather all of the data</h3>
                <p>
                  from our usability study in one place. We might have collected
                  data in various formats such as stacks of sticky notes, a
                  spreadsheet, audio notes, or even a notebook with our
                  scribbles. You also need to gather together the notes from
                  everyone who observed the usability study.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You now need to gather everyone sticky notes in one place.
                  Then it's time to organize the data so that it's easier to
                  interpret or understand. One method you can use to organize
                  data is called affinity diagramming.

                <p>
                  An affinity diagram is a method of synthesizing that organizes
                  data into groups with common themes or relationships. Affinity
                  diagramming is a quick and easy way to gather observations
                  during a usability study and synthesized data. To make an
                  affinity diagram, you need all of the observations from
                  participants to be on sticky notes.

                    <span title="диаграммa сходств">an affinity diagram</span>,

                  In addition, affinity diagramming helps you think outside of
                  the box. The interactive and visual format of affinity mapping
                  allows you to make connections within your data that you may
                  not have noticed by simply reading through your notes. This
                  helps you think of new, creative ways to solve user problems

                <b>Organize the data</b>. This is where we take the data
                gathered in step 1 and arrange it. If you wrote your
                observations on sticky notes, you might use a method called
                affinity diagramming to organize your data. You'll learn more
                about this later. If you used spreadsheet notetaking to record
                your observations, you've already started organizing the data
                without even realizing it.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Find themes in the data</b>. One of the key goals of user
                research is to identify themes that are common across
                participants. These themes help us to turn our data into
                insights about the users. You'll find that UX designers and
                researchers often use the words, patterns, and themes
                interchangeably. Technically, they're a little different, but
                for the sake of simplicity, we're just going to use the word
                theme.
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Come up with insights for each theme</h3>
                .
                <p>
                  We want to write an insight that tells the design team how to
                  improve the product based on a theme. Depending on the amount
                  of data you've collected, you should be able to come up with a
                  handful of themes and insights.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You've now learned how to gather all of the data from your
                  research in one place, organize that data so it's easy to
                  understand, and find themes in the data.
                </p>
                <p>check out five qualities of strong insights.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <b>Strong insights are grounded in real data</b>. Insights
                    need to be based solely on what you observed during the
                    research study, not what you felt at the time. And each
                    insight should be supported by multiple pieces of data.
                    Insights are strongest when they apply to multiple study
                    participants instead of just one.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b
                      >Strong insights need to answer the research questions you
                      listed in your research plan</b
                    >. You want to tie your insight to the research questions to
                    help people understand why the insight matters. In our
                    example usability study, the research questions were: How
                    long does it take a user to find and book a dog walker in
                    the app? And what can we learn from the user flow, or the
                    steps that users take, to book a dog walker? We'll need to
                    come up with insights that answer either or both of these
                    questions.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Strong insights should be easy to understand</b>. Keep in
                    mind that your stakeholders might not have been involved in
                    the planning of your study, but you still want them to
                    understand your insights. Use simple language that doesn't
                    require detailed knowledge of the study. If you randomly
                    shared your insight with a friend, they should understand
                    what you mean. For example, an insight for our usability
                    might be: When users have to select a date, they prefer to
                    see a calendar. This insight tells the team that users find
                    it easier to pick a date in a calendar format instead of a
                    list.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b
                      >Strong insights increase empathy for the user
                      experience</b
                    >. Empathy increases the team's engagement because they put
                    themselves in the user's shoes. That extra level of
                    commitment can fuel their enthusiasm to improve the product.
                  </li>
                  <li><b>Strong insights inspire direct action</b></li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Insights identification example</h3>
                <img
                  src="images/insight-identification.png"
                  alt="insight identification"

              Designer take that insight and start building around the problem a
              new solution, which can help fix the problem.
              <b
                >Fall in love with the problem, and don't fall in love with the
                solution itself</b
              >. When you fall in love with the problem, then you can start
              identifying new and different and novel ways on solving that
              problem, which you might not necessarily think of if you hone in
              on the solution which that particular participant gave you. Now,
              that solution might work for that participant, but we're not
              designing for one person, we're designing for millions and
              billions of people. We got to find a solution which works for a
              wide variety of people and not necessarily for a subset of people.
              <i
                >In the process of solution design, which comes after a study is
                complete, it is very important to really understand not only
                what the problem was, but also why the problem occurred in the
                first place</i
              >. Once you fall in love with the understanding of the problem,
              then you are much more equipped to come up with solutions and find
              solutions which might not have been thought of in the first place.

            "How do I share my research insights with stakeholders?" Tere are
            two different formats you can use to share your insights:

                  A presentation is a group of slides where each slide has new
                  information. Presentations provide your stakeholders with a
                  high-level overview of the project. Tips for creating UX
                  research presentations that keep your audience engaged: Tip 1:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <b>Know your audience</b>. Before the presentation begins,
                    take time to find out what the people you're presenting to
                    are interested in learning about, then tailor your
                    presentation accordingly. A personalized approach keeps your
                    audience engaged during your presentation and increases your
                    ability to gain their support for your project.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Provide an overview</b>. Include a short roadmap or
                    "table of contents" at the beginning of your presentation,
                    so your audience knows what to expect throughout the
                    presentation. Your roadmap should almost be like a checklist
                    that the audience can follow along, so they have a vision
                    for how much content is left to cover. In addition, one
                    slide should feature an overview of the content you’re
                    presenting, also known as an executive summary. It’s kind of
                    like sharing your conclusion or biggest takeaways at the
                    beginning of the presentation. Be sure to discuss how your
                    research impacts the big picture, like how the product would
                    support the company’s goals and objectives. When your
                    audience understands the overall goal of the presentation
                    and your product from the start, they’ll have a better
                    context for specific details and stories you provide later.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Tell a story</b>. Think of your presentation as a story
                    with a beginning, middle, and end. Each slide should push
                    the story you’re telling forward, and the story should flow
                    from slide to slide. Part of telling an effective and
                    engaging story is including examples of actual users, such
                    as quotes, photos, or short video clips from interactions
                    with users. Storytelling is more powerful than sharing a
                    list of research insights because your audience can observe
                    the emotions, pain points, and delights of your product from
                    a real user’s point of view.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Show numbers</b>. A strong image often communicates more
                    clearly than words. Use data, graphs, and charts to
                    illustrate your most important insights. Your goal is to
                    keep the attention of your audience, so let the images and
                    data you show speak to your audience and strengthen the
                    story you’re telling.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Less is more when it comes to text</b>. Keep the
                    information you present short and to the point. Your slides
                    should only include high-level details that answer questions
                    like why, what, and how. Try to include minimal text on your
                    slides so that the audience doesn't spend time reading while
                    you're presenting. If necessary, you can add additional
                    resources in the appendix of your presentation for the
                    audience to review later.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Provide recommendations for next steps.</b> End the
                    presentation with a list of recommended next steps based on
                    the insights you presented. Your recommendations might
                    include changes to make to the product designs, additional
                    research to conduct, or future meetings to schedule. This
                    step helps gain support from stakeholders and will put the
                    pieces in place to move forward in the design process. It's
                    a best practice to clearly state your recommendations on a
                    single slide.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Leave time for questions</b>. At the end of your
                    presentation, be sure to leave a few minutes so your
                    audience can ask questions about the material you presented
                    and can clarify any points. This is also a great opportunity
                    for you to provide more details about areas that your
                    audience is interested in learning more about.

                A research report is a document with fewer visuals containing
                the same information as the presentation. This allows
