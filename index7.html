            <h3>Design cross device</h3>
            <p>
              As a UX designer, our goal is to always put the user first and
              keep their needs front and center. When it comes to designing
              across devices and products, like you'll be doing in this project,
              there are a couple of approaches you can take.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <h4>Progressive enhancement</h4>
                <p>
                  Designing from the smallest screen to the largest screen. The
                  progressive enhancement approach is also known as bottom-up
                  designing, because you first design for the smallest and most
                  basic version of your site, like for a mobile phone, and then
                  embellish your designs for larger screen sizes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The progressive enhancement approach allows us designers to
                  focus on the basic capabilities of the product we're designing
                  at the beginning of the project. By starting with a small
                  screen size, we have to choose the most important elements to
                  prioritize on the screen. Then we can add more advanced
                  features and interactions as we move to larger devices and
                  screen sizes. As a designer, using the progressive enhancement
                  approach allows you to highlight the most important content
                  from the start, and come up with a clear vision of how the
                  website should appear on all device sizes and types.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Progressive enhancement is closely related to a mobile-first
                  philosophy. A mobile-first philosophy means that we start by
                  designing the mobile version of a product, and later adapt it
                  to fit larger screens, like tablets, laptops, and desktop
                  computers. In the past, many designers started with the
                  desktop version of a website and then tried to adapt it for
                  smaller screens, like tablets and mobile phones. But in recent
                  years, a mobile-first approach has become increasingly popular
                  in the world of UX design. Why? Well, each year, the number of
                  mobile phone users around the world grows. Since we're
                  designing with the users' needs front and center, this means
                  designing for the devices and screen sizes they're using most.

              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Graceful degradation</h4>
                <p>
                  means designing from the largest screen to smaller screens.
                  The graceful degradation approach is also known as top-down
                  designing, because you start with a large screen with a lot of
                  features and interactions, and work your way down toward a
                  smaller screen, where the features and interactions are scaled
                  back.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The graceful degradation approach became popular among UX
                  designers when desktop computers were the most-used device.
                  We'd start with the desktop version of a website, since that's
                  where the users were most, and then try to adapt our designs
                  for smaller screens, like tablets and mobile phones.
                </p>

            <h3>Designing for mobile first</h3>
            <p>
              A mobile-first design philosophy is related to the practice of
              progressive enhancement, which is designing for the smallest and
              most basic version of a product before creating larger, more
              complex versions. By starting with a small screen size, designers
              have to choose the most important elements to prioritize on the
              screen. This approach contrasts with graceful degradation, which
              is designing for a larger screen with a lot of features and
              interactions first, then scaling back the designs to fit a smaller
              screen.
            </p>
            <p>
              More people than ever are using mobile devices as a primary means
              of accessing the internet. According to the World Advertising
              Research Center, by 2025, 72% of all internet users will use
              smartphones as their only method of accessing the internet. A
              large portion of these users are the Next Billion Users, who are
              the people around the world who are starting to use the internet
              for the first time, often through mobile devices. The content,
              interactions, and features of products you design need to be
              accessible for the Next Billion Users, so a mobile-first
              philosophy is key. To learn more, this article from Google
              <a
                href="https://design.google/library/connectivity-culture-and-credit"
                >Design that shares nine ways designers can be more empathetic
                and effective when creating products for emerging markets</a
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mobile-first designs help users quickly access content because
              fewer elements and features have to load. This is important
              because mobile phones don’t have as much computer power as desktop
              computers do. If you design for a larger screen size first, it can
              be difficult later to incorporate all of the design elements of a
              complex screen into a smaller one without impacting load time.
              This is just another reason why a mobile first design philosophy
              can be useful.

            <h3>Learn more about designing across devices</h3>
            <p>
              As a UX designer, it’s important to consider how the designs you
              create will adapt for multiple devices, including desktop
              computers, tablets, mobile phones, smartwatches, TVs, and smart
              displays. The list of devices with screens that need UX design is
              growing every day!
            </p>
            <img src="images/various-devices.png" alt="various type of devices" />
            <p>
              As you design across devices, you’ll need to consider the device’s
              screen size, the interaction between the device and the user, the
              way content will be organized on various screen sizes, the way
              users will interact with each device, and more.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Consistency:</b> Having a uniform design, so users can expect
                the design to feel familiar across devices and products
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Continuity:</b> Providing users with a smooth and
                uninterrupted experience as they move between devices
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Context:</b> Designing for the needs of a specific device and
                the way in which the user will use that device in any given
                situation
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Complementary:</b> Taking into account how the product design
                on each device can make the overall user experience better

            <h2>Overview of the UX design interview process</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Pre-interview research: </b>After you apply and before your
                first interview, you should conduct research on the company and
                the job. This is the first step in learning more about the role
                and preparing to answer interview questions. Plus, it’s a good
                way to know whether you’re a good fit for the position!
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Introductory call or phone screen: </b>The first interview is
                often in the form of an introductory call with a recruiter or
                hiring manager. The purpose of this call is to verify whether
                you meet the minimum set of requirements for the role.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Design exercise: </b>You might be asked to complete a design
                exercise before your next interview. A design exercise is a
                prompt asking you to create a design that solves a specific
                problem, just like the Sharpen prompts you’ve been completing
                through the program! You'll usually conduct the design exercise
                from your own home and will have a certain amount of time to
                complete the exercise. We'll share more details about design
                exercises later in the course!
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Second round of interviews: </b>During the second interview,
                interviewers and hiring managers will explore your experience in
                more depth, so that the team you’re applying to can understand
                how closely your background fits the specific role.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Panel interview: </b>A panel interview is a type of interview
                that's common during the second round of interviews. You'll meet
                with a group of people at the same time to assess your skills
                and learn more about how you interact with a group of people.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Whiteboard interview: </b>During the whiteboard interview,
                you’ll really showcase how you work as a UX designer. This
                interview includes a practical demonstration of your skills in
                real-time for interviewers to understand your thinking process
                and overall abilities. If you were asked to complete a design
                exercise earlier in the process, you might not be asked to
                complete a whiteboard interview too. We'll share more details
                about whiteboard interviews soon.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Portfolio presentation: </b>You’ll present your portfolio
                website, explain your background in UX design, and talk about
                your case studies, including the user problem you were solving
                and your takeaways were from the process. We'll share more
                details about portfolio presentations later in the course.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Job offer: </b>The final step of the interview process is the
                job offer. This is when the hiring manager asks you to join the
                team!

            <h3>Star method</h3>
            <p>
              Use the STAR method to answer interview questions clearly and
              directly. Using the STAR method can make your responses easy to
              follow and provide a logical structure to each story you share.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>S is for situation.</b> Describe the context around a
                particular circumstance, challenge, or event you experienced.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>T is for task.</b> Describe your responsibility in this
                situation. What were you asked to do, or what problem were you
                asked to solve?
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>A is for action</b>. Describe what you did to meet the
                challenge or solve the problem. Give specific details that
                demonstrate your abilities in the job.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>R is for result</b>. Describe the outcome of the project or

                results more concrete.

              What does the STAR method look like in action? Well, we asked
              three UX designers at Google to use the STAR method to answer
              these common UX design interview questions:
            </p>

              <li>
                Can you tell me about a time when you did your own research?

              <li>
                What part of the design process do you enjoy doing the most?
                Why?
              </li>
              <li>
                How have you handled receiving negative feedback about your
                designs?

              For this exemplar, the person preparing for an interview expects
              to be asked:
            </p>
            <p>
              Can you tell me about a time when you did your own research to
              understand user needs?
            </p>
            <p>
              Using the STAR method, the person writes out this possible
              response:

              Recently, I completed a UX certification program where we were
              tasked with designing an app and website to help individuals limit
              their food waste. (Situation) The mock organization knew that
              people wanted to limit waste but didn’t know how to help. (Task) I
              reached out to interview participants in two categories: people
              who were already working to mitigate food waste and people who
              wanted to but didn’t know how to start. Through in-depth
              interviews, I discovered that the base issue revolved around
              understanding how long food (both cooked leftovers and fresh
              ingredients) lasted once it was in their fridge. (Action) That led
              me to develop a product that helped keep an accurate inventory of
              food that was easy to update and reminded users when it was time
              to eat something and how they could use it. (Result)

            <h3>Review templates for proposals</h3>
            <p>When you work as a freelance UX designer, potential clients who are impressed by your designs might send you <b>a request for proposal, an official document that outlines project requirements</b>. Or, they may submit an informal request to establish a working relationship with you. Gaining new clients is an exciting chance to practice your design skills. But, before diving into the creating a product, you should respond by sending a proposal. </p>
            <p>A <b>proposal outlines your approach to successfully delivering the work a client has requested</b>. These documents are important for establishing an effective working relationship between you and your client. Your proposal also helps to instill confidence in your ability to do the work on time and on budget, while meeting the project objectives. In this reading, you’ll learn about the various materials you might encounter as a freelance UX designer. </p>
            <img src="images/sections-of-proposal.png" alt="sections of proposal">
            <p>Proposals may also include an introduction to you as a designer, your design process divided into phases, and specific payment terms. </p>
            <p>To help you develop your own proposal, start with the statement of work template and budget spreadsheet template provided here:</p>
