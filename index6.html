          <p>
            Information architecture organizes content to help users understand
            where they are in a product and where the information they want is.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s important for UX designers to understand information
            architecture (IA), which organizes content to help users understand
            where they are in a product and where the information they want is.
            Information architecture is the roadmap for users to get everything
            they need from the product you’re designing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Information architecture is all about organizing the contents of
            your designs for excellent user flow. IA requires you to know the
            users you’re designing for and their goals, behaviors, and
            expectations about products like yours.
          </p>
          <p>
            To learn more about IA, review this video about the basics of
            information architecture from earlier in the certificate program.

          <h2>Site structure</h2>
          <p>
            There are four common site structures, each of these structures is
            unique and serves a specific purpose.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <img
                src="images/structure-hierarchical.jpeg"
                alt="hierarchical site structure"
              />
              <p>
                <b>Hierarchical</b> model is one of the most popular website
                structures. It's a top-down approach to structure that starts
                with top level categories of information referred to as the
                parent level. Then content is narrowed into more detailed
                information called the child level. The structure is very
                similar to a family tree, which is what the parent and child
                level terms are based on.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first page of a hierarchical website is the homepage, where
                users start. This is represented by the page 1 at the top of a
                tree. The next level contains pages for the main categories of
                content. On a website, these categories usually appear in a
                navigation bar at the top of the homepage. This is represented
                by pages 2, 3, and 4 in the diagram. Often when you hover your
                mouse over one of the categories in the navigation bar or click
                on that category, a list of additional pages within that
                category appears.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each of these pages is considered a child of the parent
                category. For example, Page 5 and Page 6 are considered child
                pages of Page 2. Hbo.com is a good example of the hierarchical
                model. The website homepage offers main categories like series,
                movies, and docs at the parent level across the top of the
                homepage. If I click on one of the category pages like "series,"
                the site offers sub-category pages at the child level, like
                featured series, specials, and sports.
              </p>
              <p>
                You might have guessed that the hierarchical model gets this
                name from the word hierarchy. In UX design, hierarchy means
                organizing your content by importance. What's the most
                important, and what's the least important? How do you connect
                this content together?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <img
                src="images/structure-sequential.jpeg"
                alt="sequetial site structure"
              />
              <p>
                <b>Sequential</b> model is a website structure that leads users
                through a step-by-step process. Sequential websites order their
                pages from a starting page to an end point, sort of in a line.
                Users start on the site's first page and click a link or button
                to go to the next page in the order. Users continue this
                pattern, clicking through the pages in order until they've
                reached the last page.
              </p>
              <p>
                In a true sequential structure, like an online survey, users
                aren't able to navigate to pages out of order. They can navigate
                between the next, and previous page but they aren't able to skip
                over pages or go to a home page.
              </p>
              <p>
                So think of this: Have you ever tried to find car insurance
                online? Almost all insurance sites are sequential forms to get a
                quote. The purpose of each page in a website that uses a
                sequential structure is to get users to the next step in the
                sequence, moving them toward an end goal.
              </p>

                alt="matrix site structure"
              />
              <p>
                <b>Matrix</b> matrix model is a structure that allows users to
                follow their own path, since content is linked in several
                different ways. Users can navigate to any page and matrix model
                website and still be able to access all of the other pages as
                well. This allows users to explore the site freely.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because all the content links to each other, the matrix model is
                sometimes referred to as the web model. Think about the homepage
                of a news website. Chances are the website has a navigation menu
                at the top, the most recent content front and center on the
                page, and then other news stories sorted into linked categories
                below. If you click on a news story, you'll find other related
                articles linked throughout the article. For example, if you're
                reading about a new star in a local zoo, you might find that a
                related story about an animal rescue is hyperlinked within the
                text. Other articles that might interest you are usually
                included at the bottom or to the side of the page too.

                One pro tip to keep in mind, this matrix model structure is
                considered outdated by some UX designers. Matrix models don't
                provide a great user experience because they can be tricky to
                navigate if you don't already know what you're looking for.
                Despite this, matrix models are still in use by many popular
                websites that want users to interact with a lot of the website's
                content, instead of sending the user on a specific journey.

              />
              <p>
                <b>Database</b> model is a website structure that mixes a
                database, or an organized collection of information, with search
                functionality. A database model creates a dynamic experience for
                users that includes advanced filtering and search capabilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                Think about your favorite social media network. Most social
                media sites have the ability to post content with tags, like a
                location, that categorizes the content. Users can search for
                content using these tags. Or think about the Google Maps
                website. When you land on the homepage, the main option you are
                presented with is to search the database for an address or a
                category of locations like restaurants.
              </p>

          </ul>
          <p>Advantages:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              users have expectations for how websites work based on their prior
              experience using other websites. Site structure models, like the
              four we just discussed, make sure that your website meets those
              user expectations;
            </li>
            <li>
              structure models improve navigation of websites as they add
              organization. Following a website structure model makes it easier
              for you as a designer to build in logical cues that orient and
              direct your users;
            </li>
            <li>
              structure models have been tested over time and have proven their
              effectiveness. They've evolved based on feedback from users and
              designers. They allow you to start building websites more quickly
              and efficiently too, since you aren't spending time inventing a
              structure from scratch.

              When planning your website in its early stages, is important to
              create a clear organizational path. By mapping an outline, you can
              see which areas of your site may require more elaborate
              connectivity to help users reach the necessary pages. It's also a
              great way to see all of your pages as a whole, in the order they
              will appear on your site to users. You might spot necessary pages
              you've forgotten, or realize you need to remove and condense
              pages.
            </li>
            <li>
              Besides helping users move from page to page, sitemaps help search
              engines index your website. If you ever wondered how a search
              engine like Google knows about all of the websites it lists on a
              search results page, this is how. Sitemaps tell Google what the
              site is about and what content it includes. The indexing process
              makes sure sites are searchable and available to a whole new set
              of users — users that may not have found your website on their
              own.
            </li>
            <li>
              A clear organizational structure is also important for
              accessibility. Users of all abilities, identities, and experiences
              need to be able to successfully move through a website's design.
              Sitemaps create an organized flow that takes your users from one
              task to the next. This is especially important for any users
              interacting with your site using assistive technology. Organizing
              your site using a clear structure allows all site visitors,
              including those using assistive technologies, to navigate your
              site more efficiently.

          <h2>Common website layouts</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h3>Single column layout</h3>
              <p>
                The single column layout features just one column for the
                website’s content, which makes it one of the simplest layout
                options. Single column layouts are often the standard design for
                mobile versions of responsive websites, since mobile phone
                screens are narrow and don't have space for multiple columns of
                content. In addition, a single column layout allows for easy
                scrolling on mobile phones.
              </p>
              <p>
                Single column layouts can be used on laptop and desktop-sized
                websites, too. This layout is especially good for emphasizing
                one main element on a page, like a logo, a video, or an entire
                block of text. Keep in mind that with a single column layout,
                elements tend to be organized logically. Websites that use this
                layout usually feature navigation at the top of the page,
                followed by content, and then a footer at the bottom of the
                page.
              </p>
              <img
                src="images/single-column-layout.png"
                alt="single column layout"
              />
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Multicolumn layout</h3>
              <p>
                The multicolumn layout has two or more columns for content. Many
                desktop websites use multiple columns to make the most of the
                space on the screen. When you're designing a responsive website
                in this course, the mobile phone sized version of your website
                might use a single column layout, while the desktop sized
                version might use a multicolumn layout since there's more space
                to add elements.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you design a website with multiple columns, keep
                top-of-mind the visual design elements and principles that you
                learned earlier in the certificate program. For example, you'll
                want to lay out elements within each column based on hierarchy,
                color, and variety. One pro tip: On many multicolumn websites,
                one column of content on the far left or right is used for ad
                space.
              </p>
              <p>
                Websites that use a multicolumn layout usually have a clear
                focal point, which is a specific and distinct area of the
                website that captures users’ attention. In this example, the
                focal point is the article at the top of the page that's
                emphasized with a colored rectangle and large hero image.

              <h3>Box layout</h3>
              <p>
                The box layout consists of boxes or squares of various sizes and
                proportions. This layout is typically found on homepages of
                websites and is a great way to organize multiple elements. When
                boxes are the same size and they're evenly spaced, users will
                give boxes equal importance. Alternatively, some boxes can be
                larger or spaced apart from the rest to draw the user's
                attention to that box, which might show a specific image or
                item.
              </p>

              <h3>Featured image layout</h3>
              <p>
                The featured image layout places the user’s focus on a single
                image or video that often takes up the entirety of the page.
                Because of this, the featured image layout is often referred to
                as a single image layout.
              </p>
              <p>
                The featured image layout is popularly used on websites that
                want to create a strong first impression, because humans are
                naturally drawn to images. When using this layout, make sure the
                featured image or video is tied to the product’s message and is
                high in quality. The featured image layout is often accompanied
                by a fixed or “sticky” top navigation bar that stays in place as
                users scroll down the page.
              </p>

              <h3>Asymmetrical layouts</h3>
              <p>
                Asymmetrical layouts are purposefully imbalanced between
                different sides of a page to draw emphasis. This website layout
                can be useful to highlight certain design elements, like images
                or text headlines, or to divide content by order of importance.
              </p>
              <p>
                The success of asymmetrical layouts relies on natural
                eye-tracking patterns. An eye-tracking pattern describes the way
                in which users with typical vision follow content down the page
                of a website. Two common asymmetrical eye-tracking patterns are
                F-shape and Z-shape.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <h4>F-shape eye-tracking pattern</h4>
                  <p>
                    An F-shape eye-tracking pattern means that users will likely
                    browse content on the page following the shape of the letter
                    F. Laying out the page of a website following the F-shape
                    eye-tracking pattern is useful when presenting lots of
                    material, like text, since users scan information based on
                    hierarchy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This layout is commonly used on search results pages or on
                    text-heavy pages, like this web page from Wikipedia about
                    the poet Stesichorus. On pages like this one, most users
                    will not read to the bottom of the page, so it's important
                    to put the most important information at the top of the
                    page. In this example, the most important information
                    includes a summary about Stesichorus. Then, users can review
                    the subheadings down the page to navigate to information
                    that's most relevant to their needs.
                  </p>
                  <img
                    src="images/f-shape-layout.png"
                    alt="f-shape layout example"

                </li>
                <li>
                  <h4>Z-shape eye-tracking pattern</h4>
                  <p>
                    A Z-shape eye-tracking pattern means that users will likely
                    browse content on the page following the shape of the letter
                    Z, for users who read from left to right. A website layout
                    following this natural pattern draws the user’s eyes to all
                    of the information on the site, based on the order of
                    importance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Here is an example of the Z-shape eye-tracking pattern in
                    action on Dropbox's website . The user flow moves from left
                    to right, then back to the left again. Images guide users
                    between pieces of information, giving their eyes time to
                    rest and allowing them to easily scan for important
                    information.
                  </p>

              <h3>Grid of cards layout</h3>
              <p>
                A grid of cards layout features a series of cards that provide
                previews of more detailed content. A card is a rectangular shape
                that includes short, related information. Think of it like a
                playing card's shape and size, but in a digital design!
              </p>
              <p>
                At a glance, the grid of cards layout might seem similar to the
                box layout, but the two are actually quite different! In the box
                layout, each box is its own independent item. In the grid of
                cards layout, cards are correlated together within the same
                interrelated list. Think of the box layout as separate posters
                for TV shows in different genres, while the grid of cards layout
                is a collection of comedy movies.
              </p>
              <p>
                A grid of cards layout usually previews detailed content. This
                layout is often found on cooking blogs, streaming services, and
                other content-heavy sites, like YouTube and Pinterest. In a grid
                of cards layout, the cards are usually similar in size. The size
                of the cards can adapt to the screen size you're designing for,
                which makes cards great when designing responsive websites.
              </p>

              <h3>
                <span title="Многоуровневый макет слоеного торта"></span>Tiered
                layer cake layout
              </h3>
              <p>
                A tiered layer cake layout has individual rows, or layers, that
                are stacked on top of one another. Within each row, there can be
                different numbers of columns, and they don’t have to be
                consistent.
              </p>
              <p>
                The tiered layer cake layout is often used in responsive website
                design, because it adapts to the user’s screen size. The layers
                shift based on the device being used. For example, check out the
                grocery store website QFC in the images below. On the left, the
                desktop version of the website uses a tiered layer cake layout.
                But on the right, the mobile version of the website has only one
                column to better fit the screen size.

            <h2>Wireframes</h2>
            <p>
              Wireframes help establish the basic layout of a screen. A layout
              is the structure that supports how visual components on a page are
              arranged, like images, text, and icons. You can apply everything
              you just learned about common website layouts when you create
              wireframes for your responsive website.

            <h3>Plan responsive web pages</h3>
            <p>
              Responsive web design adapts easily to any screen, which increases
              the usability of a webpage. This creates a positive user
              experience for people visiting the site, regardless of the
              platform they are using. Since designers don’t have to design a
              website for every device size, it also saves them time and
              resources! Furthermore, responsive web design drives mobile
              traffic because a lot of users access the web from their mobile
              devices.
            </p>
            <p>
              Responsive web design drives mobile traffic to the website. After
              all, not everyone will be visiting a website from a desktop
              computer. A website should be viewable and accessible to users
              regardless of the platform they are using. This will create a
              positive user experience, and save designers time and resources
              from having to design for every device size.
            </p>

            <p>
              Behind the code of the website are parameters called
              <b>breakpoints</b>. Breakpoints are the visual limits that
              determine when a responsive layout should change to fit all the
              elements and components properly. In other words, if you adjust
              the shape of a browser window on your computer to a vertical
              rectangle, the website will eventually shift to the mobile version
              of the site.

              As you <span title="построение">plot</span> your own designs on
              grid paper and resize the layout for different screen sizes, ask
              yourself these questions:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Do elements on the page need to move location? As you move from
                a large screen size to smaller screen sizes, which parts of the
                design need to stay above the fold? Which can move down the
                page, to below the fold?
              </li>
              <li>
                How do images need to be scaled? Are there certain images, like
                a hero image, that need to remain large across all screen sizes?
              </li>
              <li>
                How will you adjust the navigation elements for the page as the
                screen size changes, such as moving from a top navigation bar to
                a hamburger menu?

            <h3>Common elements used in responsive design</h3>
            <p>
              Designing a responsive website requires that you know how to scale
              elements to make the best use of available screen space, from a
              desktop computer to a mobile phone. Adjusting your designs based
              on the size of the screen might mean using different amounts of
              text, utilizing icons, scaling the size of images, and more. As
              you begin to create your own responsive designs, here are some
              common elements and components that you can use.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Hamburger menus</b> are often featured in mobile versions of
                websites, because a lot of text can be placed inside of the
                list, which keeps the main pages of the design clean. In other
                words, a desktop version of a website design might have a top
                navigation bar that lists text horizontally across the screen,
                but a mobile phone screen size doesn't have room for this text,
                so it's placed within a hamburger menu.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Cards</b> are also helpful when creating responsive designs
                because they can be easily arranged in predictable ways across
                devices. Each card can contain a similar amount of information
                from desktop to mobile designs, since little content is
                included. But desktop designs might include five columns of
                cards, while mobile designs might include only two columns of
                cards.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Carousel</b> can be scaled to fit the size of the device. On
                desktop, carousels can be large or even take over an entire
                page, like a traditional slideshow would. On mobile, images
                within a carousel are smaller or might even change to a more
                compact shape, like a square instead of a rectangle.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Call-to-action</b> (CTA) button is an interactive and
                appealing button that invites users to click on it. As shown in
                the image above, CTA buttons are usually emphasized in a design
                by using a different color or font than the rest of the design.
                CTA buttons are used across all screen sizes in responsive
                design. But their appearance and function depends on each
                device. For example, CTA buttons might occupy more space on
                mobile devices than on desktop. CTA buttons might also be more
                interactive on mobile devices with touch screens, since they
                allow for more nuanced gestures beyond a simple click.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Accessibility in responsive design</h3>
            <p>
              There are a few features to include in your wireframes to ensure
              that people using assistive technology have a great user
              experience.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Headings</b> are titles or subtitles that stand out at the
                beginning of a paragraph, article, section, or another area of a
                website. Header text is often larger and bolder than the text on
                the rest of a page and designates the beginning of a section.
                Headings can be used to label menus, page titles, subtitles, and
                other related structures on a page. One reason it's important to
                make sure headings are clear in your designs, is because all
                users can benefit from headings. Headings support visual
                hierarchy, as well as support efficient navigation for users of
                screen readers. Screen readers can navigate a webpage through
                headings, which allows users to listen to a list of all
                headings, or jump to a desired heading, to begin reading at that
                point on the website. Users can use the screen reader headings
                menu to move around to key sections of the webpage.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Landmarks</b> are features used to map out regions of an
                interface. Headings, which we just discussed, serve a similar
                purpose to landmarks. Landmarks are used by assistive
                technology, like screen readers, to provide cues for navigation,
                allowing users to efficiently move from one section to another.
                Common landmarks include navigation bars, search boxes, fixed
                sidebars, and footers. Much like landmarks in real life, these
                objects or sections stand out from the rest of the page to help
                users navigate through a website. For example, iOS devices
                utilize the voiceover screen reader. It features a rotor that
                users can control by pressing the keys Ctrl+Option+U. This rotor
                tool allows users to browse webpages and switch between
                landmarks and headings for ease of navigation.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Initial focus</b> is how you attract a user's attention to
                help them accomplish a task. If your webpage requires the user
                to do several things, it's best to direct focus to the top of
                the page, or to the first H1 heading. To understand how this is
                used in real life, let's check out the Google homepage. The
                homepage of Google Search features the search bar at the center
                of the page below, a single hero image. This positioning ensures
                the user's attention is directed toward the search function. But
                the idea behind the initial focus isn't just to attract the
                user's attention; focus can also help define the primary tasks
                or actions you want the user to take. Although there are other
                links on the Google search page, defining the search bar as the
                initial focus supports the central purpose of the page. In
                general, the less clutter there is on a webpage, the easier the
                interface is to navigate. Otherwise, a user might experience
                cognitive overload, too much information, or too many tasks
                simultaneously, resulting in the user not being able to complete
                the task.
