          Design can have different levels of fidelity. In UX,
          <b
            >fidelity means how closely a design matches the look and feel of
            the final product</b
          >.
          <i
            >If a design is low fidelity, that means it has a lower amount of
            complexity and is less refined or polished</i
          >. We call low-fidelity designs lo-fi for short.
          <i
            >UX designers use low-fidelity designs when we want to get ideas out
            quickly and leave room for exploration</i
          >. If a design is high fidelity, that means it closely matches the
          look and feel of the final product and is more refined or polished
          overall. We call high-fidelity designs hi-fi for short.
          <i
            >UX designers use high-fidelity designs when we want to test a
            design that looks like a real product and get more specific feedback
            from users</i

          <p>Elements of visual design:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Typography</li>
            <li>Color</li>
            <li>Iconography</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Typography</h2>
          <p>
            Typography refers to the use of text and font. There are three steps
            to find the perfect typography for your design:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Type classification</b> is a general system to describe styles
              of type. Two of the most popular type classifications are Serif
              and Sans Serif.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Typeface</b> is the overall style of a letter. Typefaces are
              distinguished by their stroke weight, shape, type of serif, and
              line lengths. Each typeface is known by a family name. Some
              examples of serif typefaces are Times New Roman, Georgia, and
              Cambria. A few examples of sans serif typefaces include Arial,
              Helvetica, and Verdana.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Font</b> is the size, thickness, and emphasis of letters. The
              difference between typeface and font can be a little confusing. So
              let's take a look at this example. In this case, the typeface is
              Roboto. The font can be more light or bold, italicized or regular,
              and even more variations.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            To help readers better navigate the page, we need to create a
            hierarchy.
            <b
              >A typographic hierarchy is a method of ordering typefaces and
              fonts in a layout to create divisions that show users where to
              focus and how to find information</b
            >. Remember, product interfaces are often made up of a lot of words
            on the screen. Creating visual cues can help distinguish some words
            and phrases as more important than others. Two common ways to create
            typographic hierarchy are by changing the typeface's size and
            weight.
          </p>
          <p>Importanve of typography:
            <ul>
              <li>Hierarchy</li>
              <li>Legibility, or
making text easy to read. As a UX designer, one of your jobs is to make the product easier
to read and navigate. The product needs to be readable for all
users, including people with low vision.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Be sure that the typography used
in your design matches brand guidelines. <b>Brand guidelines are visual style choices
used to communicate a brand's identity, values, and mission</b>. Brand guidelines have rules on typography
and other visual design elements that have already been researched, tested, and
approved by the company's design team. Typography adds to this visual style and
displays a company's identity.</p>
          <div>
          <h2>Add product copy to mockups</h2>
          <div>
            <h3>Placeholder text</h3>
            <p>One of the most popular types of placeholder text is lorem ipsum. As you might remember, lorem ipsum has been used as placeholder text for over 500 years! As UX designers, we still use lorem ipsum today for a few very good reasons:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Using placeholder text allows you to share designs with stakeholders early, in the beginning stages of development, before your designs are finished. This is especially important when you need to get feedback or gather alignment on the direction of a product or design, before you spend too much time developing the details.</li>
              <li>Placeholder text, like lorem ipsum, is great to use during the ideation phase and when creating your first wireframes, when you want to focus on the layout of designs, not the copy.
              </li>
              <li>Using placeholder text provides you with more time to develop copy. If you're working with dedicated UX writers, or if you need to develop your own copy, coming up with the words to include in designs takes time. Using lorem ipsum allows you to continue to design while questions about the copy are being sorted.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These are pretty compelling reasons to use placeholder text in your designs! But there are some ways that using placeholder text can be disadvantageous for designers, too:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Placeholder text might confuse stakeholders or even distract them from the design.</li>
              <li>If your design is sized and adjusted to fit placeholder text, changing that text in later versions of the design can affect the overall layout.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>As a good rule of thumb: Placeholder text is often used in low-fidelity designs, like wireframes.</b></p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Real copy</h3>
            <p>As you design, you’ll start to envision what the app will look like and what it will communicate to users. Some designers feel passionately that real copy should be used from the beginning of the design process to aid in this communication. Here are a few reasons why using real copy, instead of placeholder text, can be advantageous while you design:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Using real copy from the start of the design process can lead to fewer adjustments to your designs later. For example, you won't have to resize design elements to fit the real copy.
              </li>
              <li>Thinking about real copy early in the design process provides more time to get feedback on copy-related design choices. Your design and copy work together to form one user experience. Creating design elements and copy together, from the beginning, can make them more cohesive.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Using real copy in your designs seems like a great idea! But there are also some disadvantages that need to be accounted for, such as:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Using real copy early in the design process doesn’t save you from copy edits later. As you've undoubtedly realized, UX design is a highly iterative process! You may change the copy in your designs just as many times as you change the designs themselves.</li>
              <li>Humans are drawn to words. Real copy in a prototype can distract stakeholders from commenting on design choices. If you email a low-fidelity prototype to your team with real copy included, you will likely get notes about the words you chose, instead of the visual design and functionality of the prototype, which is more important in that stage of developing the product.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>As general guidance: Real copy is often used in high-fidelity designs, like <span title="макет">mockups</span>. So at this point in the design process, you'll probably want to start adding real copy to your own app designs. </b></p>
          </div>
          <p><b>Keep in mind that using placeholder text or real copy in your designs might depend on the product you're designing, the preferences of your stakeholders or clients, and even feedback from your teammates. In some cases, it might be better to design using copy that has already been created, and in others, you may not worry about copy at all. The most important part of adding copy to your mockups is to be flexible and use what's best for the product you're designing.</b></p>

        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>Color in UX design</h2>
          <p> For now I'll explain how color choices and
          combinations are used in UX design to add emphasis and communicate branding and
          can impact accessibility:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p><b>Colors can add emphasis
          in your design</b>. A change in color can
          draw the attention of users to a focal
          point in your design. That focal point is often an important action you
          want users to take, like a sign-up link
          or a purchase button.</p>
          <p>We'll want to add emphasis
          to the importannt button. So we'll probably make that
          button a bright color. One <b>common rule that UX designers use is the 60-30-10 rule</b>. <i>One neutral color makes up 60 percent of the color
          palette in your desn. A second complementary color makes up 30 percent
          of the palette. A third accent color makes up 10 percent of the
          palette to add emphasis</i>.</p>
          </li>
            <li>
              <p>Reason why color is so important in UX design
          is that <b>colors can communicate branding, which is the visual appearance
          and voice of a company</b>. Colors play an important role in a company's brand guidelines, just like typography. Color helps define a product's
          visual identity, making it stand out
          among competitors</p>
              <p> When you're working for a
          company as a new designer, you'll need to be
          aware of how you use the company's brand
          colors in your designs. Keep color associations
          consistent, whether you're designing
          an app, website, or logo.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><b>Color choice can impact the accessibility
          of designs</b>. It's important to check the contrast between
          the colors you choose. For example the image on the left uses black text
          on a white background, which has a high contrast ratio, but the image on the right uses varying shades of green, blue, and yellow on a camo
          green background, making the text very difficult to read and therefore inaccessible. As a designer, you should follow Web Content Accessibility
          Guidelines, or WCAG, on color
          contrast standards to make sure your
          designs are accessible.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <div>
          <h3>Accessibility considerations for color</h3>
          <p>There are many resources to help designers use color in ways that are accessible to a wide range of people. For example, W3C recognized the need for improving  accessibility for people with disabilities, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities. So, they developed the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Color blindness</b> results in difficulty distinguishing between certain colors. There are three common categories of color blindness: red-green, blue-yellow, and total color blindness. To understand how color blindness can affect how users see color, visit the Colblindor <a href="https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/">Color Blindness Simulator</a>, where you can upload images and check them through various colorblind filters.
            <p>There are a few ways to keep color accessibility in mind as you design:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Use icons in designs, in addition to color</b>. For example, check out the image below: if you’re designing a form and want to indicate that a field is missing text or formatted incorrectly, do not solely rely on turning incorrect text to the color red. You should also use a red exclamation point icon. The exclamation point icon will draw users' attention to the form field with the color and the icon, so your designs will be clearer to more users.
              <img src="images/use-icon-color-blindness.png" alt="use icons">
              </li>
              <li><b>Use patterns and texture to create contrast</b>. Contrast is the difference between two or more elements in a design. Contrast is often created through black and white imagery, or the large size of header text versus the smaller size of body text. Imagine you're creating a bar graph about user research using a client’s brand colors. To create contrast without relying on color alone, you can add subtle stripes to one column and dots to another, as shown in the image below. With contrasting patterns, in addition to color, the bars in the graph will be clearly differentiated for all users.
              <img src="images/use-patterns-texture-color-blindness.png" alt="use patterns and texture">
              </li>
              <li><p><b>Avoid color combinations that could be hard to distinguish from one another</b>. Here are some color combinations that are often difficult for users who are color blind to differentiate between: green & red, green & brown, blue & purple, green & blue, light green & yellow, blue & gray, green & gray, green & black</p>
              <p>Keep in mind: If you use green in your designs, that doesn’t mean you need to avoid red, brown, blue, and gray altogether. But because these colors can be hard to distinguish, it’s better to not put those colors directly next to each other, especially for critical information. </p>
              <img src="images/avoid-colors-put-together.png" alt="avoid put togher colors">
              </li>
            </ul>

            </li>
            <li><p>People who have <b>low contrast sensitivity</b> experience objects as dim or unclear, which makes those objects more difficult for a person to identify. Many people experience low contrast sensitivity on a daily basis. For example, people who have a high visual acuity experience low contrast sensitivity when it’s dark and a digital screen is too bright, or when it’s bright and a digital screen is too dark. In addition, as people’s eyes get older, their contrast sensitivity naturally weakens.</p>
            <p>One way that you can design with low contrast sensitivity in mind is to use the luminosity contrast ratio, which is a measurement of the contrast between the background and the text color used on top of that background. As a standard, the WCAG recommends that the luminosity contrast ratio of images and text meets a contrast ratio of at least</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/contrast/">Contrast accessibility</a></p>
           </li>
            <li><b>Light sensitivity</b> is the inability to tolerate light. Users who have light sensitivity might experience your designs with a dim screen. Or they might use the operating system of their device to choose between light mode, dark mode, and high contrast mode, as shown in the image below. It's best to allow users to make these setting choices, so try designing your own light and dark modes of your own projects.</li>

          <h2>Iconography</h2>
          <div>
            <h3>Work with icons in mockups</h3>
            <p>Icons are images or symbols that stand for specific actions or tools in an app or website. Using icons in your designs can quickly communicate concepts, instead of explaining a concept's meaning with words. Icons range in style and meaning, as shown in the images above of a profile icon, a location icon, a favorites icon, and a zoom icon. There are two universal icons that are used across mobile apps and website designs: home and search. </p>
            <p><a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040449513-Add-icons-to-text-layers-with-icon-fonts">Learn more about icons and Font Awesome </a></p>
            <p><a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/740272380439725040/Material-Design-Icons">You can add Google Material Design icons directly to your workspace in Figma.</a></p>
            <p>Keep in mind these three best practices when it comes to using icons in designs:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Make icons universal</b>. Consider whether an icon is culturally or geographically specific before adding it to your designs. Will the icon make sense to a global audience, or only for users in the region where you live? Where will the users of the product you're designing be located? Your goal should be to include icons that everyone recognizes and understands, regardless of their background. For example, most users are familiar with the idea that the house icon means "home" which can help everyone navigate your app.</li>
              <li><b>Consider including a text label</b>. Usually, text labels are included in small font directly below an icon. Including a text label ensures that users who use a screen reader or a new adopter of technology are able to identify the icon. In addition, a text label can clearly describe (in one word!) what the icon means, like writing the label "Search" under a magnifying glass icon.
              </li>
              <li><b>Keep branding clear</b>. Everything, including your icons, should reflect the imagery you’ve created for your brand. That means that everything across your app needs to have the same color scheme, the same font, and and the same style. For example, check out the icon set  for the Material Design website, and you’ll notice that the color and design flow well between each icon set, and none of the icons look out of place.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>As you continue to design your own mockups using visual design elements, keep in mind these two things:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Visual appeal</b>: Consider how the content of your designs will be experienced by users in the real world. Are your lines connecting or dividing the right design elements? Are any shapes accidentally overlapping? Did your image upload correctly to Figma? You'll want to review your work with a heightened attention to detail, specifically looking for elements of your designs that might not be the most visually appealing.</li>
              <li><b>Accessibility</b>: As you design mockups, think about how users with various accessibility needs might react to the elements you include. For example, do headers stand out from the information placed below, by using lines or another visual design element? And, do all of your images have alternative text? Ensuring that your designs are accessible for everyone is critical to making your work a success!</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="images/benefits-of-images.jpeg" alt="benefits of including images in the app">
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Additional design considerations</h2>
          <div>
            <h3>Hyperlinked text</h3>
            <p>A hyperlink is a link from one page or file to another, usually activated by clicking on a blue, underlined word or image. Hyperlinks allow people to easily navigate digital products, and a standard stylization makes links instantly recognizable when the text is blue and underlined.</p>
            <p>Here are a few things to keep in mind when adding hyperlinks to your mockups:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>1. An uncluttered page is easier to read. Hyperlinks can keep your designs organized, making it easy for users to navigate your product. However, adding lots of hyperlinks can reduce readability and impact usability. Choose hyperlinks thoughtfully so you don’t overwhelm and distract your users with too much blue text.</li>
              <li>2. Meet user expectations. If text is underlined and blue, it should always be a link! Don't confuse your users by ignoring common conventions.</li>
              <li>3. Not all links look the same. As UX design has evolved, so has the way that links are represented in digital products. Sometimes, a company’s brand standards mean their links won’t be blue. Images can also be hyperlinks. For example, many users now expect the logo on a company’s website to link to the homepage. Even without underlined text, users expect the logo to work like a link.</li>
              <li>4. Use descriptive links. Hyperlinked text should give users an accurate idea of where it will take them. Avoid hyperlinking the word "here," and use a descriptive phrase instead, like "French Quarter Reservation Confirmation." Descriptive language allows users to make informed choices.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Buttons</h3>
            <p>Buttons let users take specific actions, like “Cancel” or “Save.” Here are a few best practices to follow when using buttons in your mockups.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>1. Make buttons look like buttons. Buttons should be easily recognizable as buttons through their shape, size, and color. Most buttons are rectangles or circles, so a star- or heart-shaped button could confuse users.</li>
              <li>2. Be consistent. Use the same type of button consistently throughout your product. For example, if you use a ghost button on your app’s homepage, you should use that same style on every screen. Consistency helps users recognize which elements are buttons.</li>
              <li>3. Include negative space. Leave negative (or white) space around buttons so that users can easily tap or click them. UX designers often add padding to buttons, which is extra negative space that keeps the screen from becoming too cluttered. Padding also makes it less likely that users will accidentally tap a neighboring button. </li>
            </ul>

          <h3>Inputs</h3>
          <p>Inputs are text fields where users enter information. It should be clear what information belongs in an input. It should also be big enough to fit the information to be added.. Consider the following best practices when adding inputs to your mockups:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>1. Use visual cues. Most inputs are open-ended, which means users can type anything into the field. But they also require specific information from users, like a phone number or an email address. To help your users enter the right information (and avoid error messages), give them visual cues. For example, you can use ghost text (also called hint text), which models the information an input requires.  Ghost text is often lighter than the rest of the words on a screen, and it disappears once users enter their information.</li>
            <li>Group inputs using subcategories. When adding more than six inputs to a page, it’s best to group them into categories. For example, you could make a "Personal Information" category that includes inputs for the user’s first name, last name, date of birth, gender, and so on. Similarly, a "Contact Information'' category could include inputs for an email address, phone number, street address, city, and so on. Grouping inputs makes it easier for users to know what information is needed and visualize their progress.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Layouts</h2>
          <p><b>Layouts are ways to arrange elements on a page</b>. Layouts usually refer to the specific placement of text, style, icons, and images. The goal of layouts is to present information in a logical way, making the important elements stand out. Without a thoughtful layout, your designs will be difficult for users to interact with. Layouts can easily be borrowed or reused from other projects with similar pages.</p>

        <div>
          <h2>Negative spaces</h2>
          <p><b>Negative space is the area that surrounds an object within an image</b>. In other words, negative space is the gaps between elements in a design or the space that’s not being occupied. Negative space is also often called white space or empty space. Many UX designers prefer the term negative space because backgrounds of designs aren’t always white, and the space that's empty in the design will reflect the background color. </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Use negative space to indicate if elements are related</b>. If two objects are positioned closely together on a page without negative space between them, they will be perceived as being related. This concept is based on the Gestalt Principle of proximity, which you explored earlier in this program. Remember that proximity means that elements that are close together appear to be more related than elements that are spaced far apart. In your mockups, use negative space thoughtfully in order to indicate which elements of your designs are related or not. </li>
            <li><b>Negative space draws attention to important elements</b>. Users generally have short attention spans! If the information on a page or screen isn’t easily scannable, you'll lose user attention quickly. Using negative space is one way to help users focus on the reason that they opened the page or app. For example, using negative space around a button in your mobile app design will help users focus on the most important action, clicking the button. </li>
            <li><b>Negative space gives users a visual break</b>. Negative space helps prevent users from becoming overwhelmed or distracted. The negative or white space in your designs can provide users with a visual break as they scan the content.</li>
            <li><b>Negative spacing increases readability</b>. You’ve probably encountered online sales that advertise an entire page full of items. The page is usually really colorful, with a lot of information to sift through, including prices and descriptions. Ads like these tend not to include much negative space, which can make the information appear overwhelming and difficult to read. Instead, you can use negative space in your mockups to make text easy to read at a glance.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Common screens in mobile apps</h3>
          <p>You may have noticed that mobile apps tend to have certain types of screens in common. The layout and appearance may differ between apps, but they all share the same purpose and design considerations. Below are some of the most common types of mobile app screens. Keep them in mind as you begin creating wireframes for your mobile app portfolio project.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>Home screen</h4>
              <p>The home screen is the first screen users encounter when they open an app. Home screens display the app’s main content and features, and serve as a starting point for users to explore further. Since the home screen lets users know what an app has to offer, the content needs to be easy to understand, use, and navigate. Common navigation elements, like a bottom navigation menu and a search icon, make it easy to get started with an app because they are familiar to many users. It can be tempting to fill a home screen with lots of content, but that can create a cluttered and overwhelming experience for users. Focusing on essential content—and making good use of white space—makes home screens easier to use.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Onboarding screens</h4>
              <p>Onboarding screens introduce first-time users to an app’s main components and functions. They can help users get started quickly, especially if an app has unique or unfamiliar features. Onboarding screens can also collect information to create a more personalized user experience. Designers have a lot of options when it comes to these screens, so they should be tailored to the experience of a particular app.</p>
              <p>A good onboarding flow can boost user engagement and retention. But because they’re often made up of several screens, they need to be easy to navigate. Designers can minimize drop-off by using clear, concise copy and engaging graphics to create a seamless and memorable experience.
</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Profile/Account screen</h4>
              <p>A profile, or account, screen contains a user’s personal details (like their name and email) and their app preferences (like order history and accessibility settings). Because a profile screen contains a lot of important information, it should be clearly organized and easy to navigate. That’s why it’s a best practice to make them as simple and clean as possible.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Checkout Screen</h4>
              <p>The checkout screen is where users complete purchases. Checkout can be more complex than other parts of an app since it usually involves a few forms for payment and shipping info. This step can be stressful, so it’s important that users feel as safe as possible. Designers can help by making it clear what information is needed for each form field and adding visual cues to indicate that a field has been filled out correctly. They can also let users know their personal data is secure and include a confirmation message when a user completes a purchase successfully.
</p>
            </li>

        <h2>Apply visual design principles to mockups</h2>
        <div>
          <p><b>Emphasis means something that attracts attention.</b>  We use emphasis to intentionally guide a user to what we want them to pay attention to. In our mockups, we want to use emphasis to provide cues that indicate to the user what is more important or less important on each page or screen.</p>
          <p>To emphasize one part of your design over another, give it more visual weight. <b>Visual weight is a measure of the force color, or contrast, can give an element greater visual weight</b>. Using variables like size, color, or contrast, can give an element greater visual weight. No matter the item, everything has a visual weight.</p>
          <p>The key considerations to think through when you're deciding what to emphasize are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>where do I want to draw the user's attention?</li>
          <li>what are the user's goals?</li>
        </ul>
          <p>Using emphasis strategically can make it easier for your users to complete tasks, and that creates a great user experience. So let's examine the role emphasis plays to get users to take action. It should be easy for users to find any action or important information they need to complete a task. As you examine your user journey, you might ask yourself, how am I making it easy for users to complete the tasks they need to do? This might involve adjusting your design's navigation based on the results of any usability studies you conduct at this point. Basically, if someone isn't finding a critical feature easily during the study, you want to find a better way to emphasize it.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Use emphasis in mockups</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Size</b>, implementing changes to the size of elements in your designs is an easy way to provide emphasis for users by drawing their attention to larger objects while simultaneously conveying that one object is more important than another. </li>
            <li><b>Contrast</b> is the creation of opposing visual elements to convey emphasis or comparison. Contrast is a great way to draw emphasis to elements in a design that are different or important. In the image below, the checkout cart and "order" buttons are colored bright red and purple which contrasts with the otherwise white and gray app. </li>
            <li><b>Texture</b> is the elements within an object that add depth or a pattern to an object. Texture can make an object stand out from other objects within a design and should be used sparingly to draw the user’s gaze.</li>
          </ul>

        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Hierarchy in UX design</h3>
          <p><b>Hierarchy is a visual design principle that orders elements on a page and highlights them by their importance</b>. The goal of hierarchy is to guide the user. Adjusting size and color is a common way to distinguish hierarchy in visual design. Hierarchy in UX design can help the user understand the relative importance between different elements.</p>
          <img src="images/emphasis-hierarchy.jpeg" alt="">
          <ul>
            <li>Hierarchy highlights elements on the page by their importance.</li>
            <li>Hierarchy also affects accessibility for users. Earlier, you learned about assistive technologies that can help users focus on the most important information on the page, like screen readers. By using accessibility annotations in your wireframes, or in this case, mockups, users will be able to read elements in a hierarchical order. Accessibility annotations create a visual hierarchy by indicating the order that elements on a screen should be read.</li>
            <li>Hierarchy can help users understand the order in which they should interact with each element.</li>
          </ul>

        <div>
          <h3>Use scale and proportion in mockups</h3>
          <p>Scale and proportion are design concepts you can strategically incorporate in your mockups to help make a design visually pleasing and capture a user’s attention.</p>
          <p><b>Scale is a concept that’s used to explain the size relationship between a given element and the other elements in the design.></b> Scale is used to draw attention to elements and help users find those elements more quickly. They also help users understand relative size.</p>
          <p><b>Proportion is about the balance or harmony between elements that are scaled. </b></p>
          <p>UX designers often use scale to make the most important elements in a design bigger than less important elements, which helps create emphasis and contrast. Proportion helps UX designers make sure the size relationship between elements makes sense and that the elements on the screen are balanced against each other.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Use unity and variety in mockups</h3>
          <div>
            <h4>Unity</h4>
            <p><b>Unity measures how well design elements work together to create a consolidated design idea.</b></p>
            <p>Your design is much more than elements on a frame. Unity is how all of those elements come together to help users as they meet the goal you’ve established for your product design. You can think of it as all of the elements unifying together to paint the design that you’ve been imaging as you build this mockup. As you start thinking about unity for use throughout your products, there are a few things that you can look for:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>How elements align with each other</b></li>
              <li><b>The shape of elements </b></li>
              <li><b>Continuity within text elements</b></li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p><b>Variety refers to diversifying the elements in your design to break up monotony and create visual interest.</b></p>
          </div>

        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Gestalt Principles</h3>
          <p><b>Gestalt Principles describe how humans group similar elements, recognize patterns, and simplify complex images when perceiving objects</b>. In other words, the human brain attempts to organize information by subconsciously arranging the parts into a cohesive whole. Applying Gestalt Principles in your mockups will help create user-friendly designs that are rooted in psychology and human behavior. </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Similarity</b>: Elements that look similar are perceived to have the same function.</li>
            <li>Proximity</b>: Elements that are close together appear to be more related than elements that are spaced farther apart.</li>
            <li><b>Common region</b>: Elements located within the same area are perceived to be grouped together.</li>
            <li><b>Closure</b> describes that when a human looks at an incomplete object, they subconsciously complete the image to see a whole, completed object. <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/05/improve-your-designs-with-the-principles-of-closure-and-figure-ground-part-2/">Improve Your Designs With The Principles Of Closure And Figure-Ground</a></li>
            <li><b>Continuity</b> states that elements that are arranged in a line or on a curve appear to be more related than elements not on the line or curve. In other words, continuity guides a user’s eye from object to object, following a line, and focuses attention to specific parts of the screen.</li>
            <li>
              <p><b>Symmetry</b> describes that elements are more visually pleasing when the parts of an object are balanced or are mirror images of each other. In addition to looking nice, objects that are symmetrical are also perceived as related to each other. In the graphic above, the dark green shape on the left is duplicated in a light green shape on the right. The only difference in these two symmetrical shapes is the shade of green used. </p>
              <p><b>Asymmetry</b>, which is a lack of balance and equality, can emphasize an element's importance and create visual interest. Using asymmetry in your designs can help call attention to a specific item or grouping of items. In the graphic above, the green shape on the left uses straight lines, and the yellow shape on the right uses curved lines, which makes them asymmetrical. </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <img src="images/design-review-checklist.jpeg" alt="design review checklist">
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Consider additional visual design elements and principles</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Value</b> of colors  is a color’s lightness or darkness.</li>
            <li><b>Saturation</b> refers to the intensity and richness of color.</li>
            <li><b>Orientation</b> refers to the layout of your design.</li>
            <li><b>Intrinsic interest</b> refers to how eye-catching a visual element is to users. Certain design elements, like logos or animations, are meant to grab a user’s attention.</li>
            <li><b>Perceived physical weight</b> is the illusion of weight and volume that each visual element conveys. When creating elements that simulate objects with physical weight, you’ll want each element’s dimensions to proportionately relate to the others. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Choosing different visual elements allows you to create more interesting, appealing, and usable designs. As you continue your design journey, remember that each element can enrich the user’s experience and interactions with your products. Take the time to map out your visual choices and your reasons for choosing them. In UX design, there are no coincidences!</p>

        <div>
          <h3>Include navigation in mockups</h3>
          <p>Types of navigation:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Navigation bars</b> display the navigation links to the most important pages of the product in a single bar along one area of the screen. Depending on the design, this bar can be horizontal or vertical. Navigation bars are easy to find and give users a clear look at all of the areas of the website that they can interact with. This helps your users get exactly where they want to go. For basic websites, like a portfolio, it’s more beneficial to have a simple navigation bar for potential employers to browse. </li>
            <li><b>Tab bars</b> are very similar to navigation bars, but they display page links as tabs that can be clicked on and off. Tab bars can be icons, they can be text, or they can be both. As you think about your own designs, know that tab bars are a great way to sort out your content and keep the user engaged with the content on your site.</li>
            <li><b>Navigation menu</b> is a menu that appears when the user clicks the three lines icon on the edge of the screen. These are sometimes called “hidden” menus (because they can be hidden away again) or “hamburger” menus (because of their shape). These menus are usually located at the top left or right of the screen and are easy for users to quickly locate. They also make the screen appear more visually appealing by “hiding” the details of the menu until the user taps to open it. A navigation menu is a great way to showcase all of the links that you want to include without having to make them fit within your design parameters. </li>
            <li><b>Navigation hub</b> displays a collection of links on the homepage of the website. With a navigation hub, the user often has to go back to the homepage to change pages. This format helps reduce the amount of content on the screen at one time. There is often a visible back button on each page that takes you back to the homepage where all of the navigation links are located. A navigation hub might be ideal for you if your designs don’t have a lot of pages but, if your users need to multitask and move from one page to another, a navigation hub might not be the best option</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Navigation organizes information so users can interact with other parts of a product. Navigation design is made up of elements, like buttons and icons, that create a clear, easy path for users so they can reach their goal. </p>
          <p>Navigational design elements:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Buttons</b>: These can be fully designed buttons or clickable elements, like text or icons. Buttons might be animated to look clickable or have a line underneath them to show their interactivity. </li>
            <li><b>Icons</b>: Icons are like visual shortcuts for the brain. Common icons include an envelope icon that represents an email inbox, a house icon that takes the user to the homepage, or a social media website's logo that takes users to a social media page. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>These navigation elements are considered <span title="Возможность или аффорданс — такое свойство предмета или объекта окружающей среды, которое позволяет использовать его определенным образом.">affordances</span>. <b><span title="Доступность - это визуальный признак назначения объекта в интерфейсе.">An affordance is a visual cue of an object’s purpose within an interface</span></b>. They “afford” you the opportunity to perform an action by providing you with hints about their context. Affordances are an important part of creating effective navigation. For example, if your button is just text on the page, a user needs an affordance of some kind to know that that text is interactive. </p>

        <div>
          <p><b>A design system is a series of reusable elements and guidelines that allow teams to design and develop a product following predetermined standards.</b></p>
          <p>Design systems help teams combine all of these different guidelines in one place, including important information like brand guidelines, components, color palettes, and more. For example, a design system outlines rules about how to use your company's brand colors in your designs, and which colors should be used for icons and typography.</p>
          <img src="images/design-system-visual-elements.jpeg" alt="design system visual elements">
          <p>Most design systems include visual styles, guidelines for how to apply them, UI patterns, and supporting code for developers.</p>

          <h3>Design critique sessions</h3>
          <p><b> A design critique session is a planned period where UX designers present their work to team members and listen to feedback</b>. Critiques are a great opportunity to practice giving and receiving feedback to and from fellow team members.</p>
          <p>During a critique, your team gathers to explore new ideas and possible directions for a design. These are planned ahead of time with an agenda and set objectives, so you’ll have time to prepare and bring fresh ideas to the table. Gathering together, whether in person or virtually, builds rapport and encourages collaboration across teams.</p>
          <p>A design critique session is made up of three groups of participants:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b><span title="координатор">Facilitator</span> of a design critique is in charge of running the critique session and guiding the feedback process. They may keep track of the time and create the agenda and goals for the meeting.</b> The facilitator is also responsible for ensuring everyone in the meeting is included and gets to share their ideas. Whether it’s because of a personality trait of an individual or a bias of the group, some people are going to be left out of the process if they’re not directly engaged.</li>
            <li><b>Presenter is the designer sharing their work with the team throughout the session.</b> This could also be a group of designers who worked together. They might share their designs directly from Figma or Adobe XD, like a screen share, or they might create a presentation in Google Slides or Microsoft PowerPoint with images of their designs.</li>
            <li><b>Reviewers offer feedback on the designs presented and what steps are needed to improve the designs</b>. There are often multiple reviewers and multiple critique sessions to look at the design from different perspectives.</li>
            <li><b>Notetaker, who documents the ideas and keeps track of all the feedback so the conversations can flow without interruption</b>. The notetaker will likely record notes in a digital document so the notes can be shared with the entire group later.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>When it comes to presenting in design critique sessions, preparation is key. This is your chance to showcase your work to your peers. Make sure you can tell the story of your designs. You’ll want to guide reviewers through your thinking behind the designs and explain how they align with the product’s goals. To help you with this, focus on answering these five questions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Who are you designing for?</li>
            <li>What problem are you trying to solve?</li>
            <li>How are your designs solving or not solving those problems?</li>
            <li>Where in the design process are you?</li>
            <li>What aspects of your designs are you seeking feedback on?</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>High-fidelity prototypes</h2>
        <p>Low-fidelity prototypes are interactive versions of designs that use content placeholders. On the other hand, <b>high-fidelity prototypes are detailed, interactive versions of designs that closely match the look and feel of the final product</b>.</p>
        <p>Essentially, a high-fidelity prototype takes the design work you've already done in the mockups and makes it interactive. Remember that <b>mockups focus on visual design, but prototypes focus on functionality</b>. A high-fidelity prototype must have these three pieces:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>visual elements</b> like color, images, icons, and typography. you'll need to finalize all of the visual elements within the prototype. Basically, this means confirming any written content, illustrations, graphics, and external links that will be part of the final product. In an ideal world, you'll coordinate with other members of your team to make sure you have realistic pieces of content to include in your high-fidelity prototype.</li>
          <li><b>navigation</b> to help users move between screens. The second part of high-fidelity prototypes that you'll need to finalize is the navigation for the user flow you want to test. Your low-fidelity prototypes should have already taken into account the critical user journey, also known as the main user flow. Navigation is important because it helps users explore and enjoy your product. Without a good navigation system in place, users will struggle or even stop using your product.</li>
          <li><b>interaction</b>, like gestures and motion, which make the prototype function</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="images/steps-to-create-hi-fidelity-prototype.jpeg" alt="steps to create hi-fidelity prototype">
        <p>Interaction</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To create a connection, first select the item you want to be the hotspot. This is where the user's interaction will take place. You can create a hotspot on anything, like a button, icon, or heading.</li>
          <li>Second, make the connection. This is the arrow or noodle that connects the hotspot to the destination. You can make a connection by clicking the little blue plus sign inside the circle.</li>
          <li>Finally, indicate the destination. This is where a connection ends. Remember, the destination has to be a frame or screen. It cannot be an item within the frame. Once you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After connecting two screens, it's time to customize the interaction details. There are three parts of an interaction to explore:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>trigger</b> defines what type of interaction will cause the prototype to advance forward. The trigger could be a mouse-click, touch gesture, or the time elapsed in the current frame.</li>
          <li><b>action</b> defines what happens when the user interacts with the hotspot. This could mean moving to another frame or opening a link.</li>
          <li><b>destination</b> could be another screen in the prototype or an overlay that appears above the current screen.</li>
        </ol>
        <div>
          <h3>Gesture and motion</h3>
          <p>Gestures are any method of interaction that a user has with information on their device using touch. In other words, gestures describe how you interact with a screen using your finger or a stylus. Common gestures include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Swipe</b>. A swipe is a brief movement with a fingertip or stylus across the screen, horizontally or vertically. For example, users often swipe from the right side of a phone screen to the left, in order to move between screens of an app. Swipes are also commonly used to interact with a carousel of content.</li>
            <li><b>Tap</b>. A tap is a brief touch of the screen by a fingertip or stylus. Taps can be customized from the use of one fingertip to four fingertips. Tapping with a single finger is often used to select an item on the screen. Tapping with two fingers can be used as a shortcut to make the context menu (also known as the right-click menu) appear.</li>
            <li><b>Drag</b>. A drag is a tap-and-hold on the screen, continuing to press down while moving a fingertip or stylus across the screen. For example, users can drag an item on a screen to move it in and out of view. Drag is often used for the main notification menu on mobile phones.</li>
            <li><b>Pinch</b>. A pinch is the movement of two fingers closing into each other or moving away from one another. A pinch allows users to scale items on a screen, like zooming in or out on a website, map, or photo. </li>
          </ul>

          <p><a href="https://m2.material.io/design/interaction/gestures.html">guide with animations of gestures from Google's Material Design</a></p>
          <p>As mobile phones have evolved, operating systems have become more characteristic to manufacturers. This is because there is a difference in the design philosophy for gestures between Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android. More specifically, iOS is based on the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/">Human Interface Guidelines</a>, or HIG for short, while Android is based on Material Design. HIG and Material Design provide designers and developers with guidelines for the gestures used for their particular operating system. As designers, it’s our job to understand these guidelines, so we can create designs that are easy to use and that meet user’s expectations.</p>
          <p><b>Motion is a way to animate static design elements to focus the user's attention and tell stories. Motion can make apps and websites more engaging and easier to use, like drawing attention to the focal point of a website or seeing a menu disappear as you drag it closed. </b></p>

          <h3>Accessibility considerations for gestures and motion</h3>
          <p>Adding motion to designs brings up new considerations to make sure your products are accessible to all users.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>always provide alternative options to using gestures. Gestures are a specific action that many groups of people might not be able to use. For example, some users might not have complete control of their hands or be able to see the screen, which can make some gestures difficult. The best accessibility principle to follow is to make sure that a gesture is not the only way to complete a task, a gesture should be one option.</li>
            <li>think critically about the speed and duration of motion in your designs. Very fast motion can be disturbing and alarming to people. In addition, motion that goes on for too long can be distracting and can create confusion. The World Wide Web Consortium, also called W3C, recommends that animations are under five seconds long in order to be accessible. In Figma, your time motion by the millisecond.</li>
            <li>give users the ability to turn off a motion. As you step into the world of UX design, it's important to design for users by ensuring that the motion in your designs is accessible.</li>

          <h2>Identifying when a design is complete</h2>
          <p>There are some important questions to ask yourself to help you decide whether your designs are complete.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Do the designs represent the intended user experience?</li>
          <li>Have placeholder text, icons, and imagery been replaced with finalized assets?</li>
          <li>Are participants or users able to interact with and interpret the designs without external guidance?</li>
          <li>Do the designs follow the existing design system?</li>
          <li>Do the designs follow common interaction patterns for their respective platforms?</li>
          <li>Do users have a clear path when something goes wrong?</li>
          <li>Is the design accessible?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you can answer “yes” to all of these questions, then you’re in a good place to consider your designs complete! Your designs should fulfill the scope of the project that was set initially and address the user problem that you set out to solve.</p>
        <p>Once your designs are complete, you can hand them off to the engineering team, who will build the final product.</p>
        <p>Keep in mind: This doesn’t mean that you’ll never need to make changes or iterate on your designs in the future. As people use the product in the real world, they’ll find flaws or missing features that you can add or improve to make the user experience even better. As you become more experienced in UX design, you’ll feel more and more comfortable knowing when a design is as polished as possible for the next step in the process.</p>
        <p><a href="https://medium.com/@andreas.johansson.dev/ux-process-how-do-you-know-when-your-design-is-done-a-simple-14-point-checklist-21b747e82954">UX Process: How do you know when your design is done? A simple 14-point checklist</a></p>
        <p><a href="https://uxplanet.org/how-do-i-know-if-my-design-is-finished-a996543820b4">How do I know if my design is finished?</a></p>
        <p>Now your design will go to engineers to code:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>At a design agency or small business, the hand-off process might be similar to a relay race. If you're not familiar, a relay race is a type of running race that involves a team. One person sprints a section of the race then passes the baton to the next person, who then starts running their section of the race. Similarly, in this method of design production, UX designers finalize every aspect of their designs before handing them off to the next team, which is engineering. At that point, the UX designers are no longer intensely involved in the project, so they can move on to something new.</li>
          <li>At larger companies like Google, the design team and the engineers often work closely together throughout the development process. The designs might be mostly done, but still need some tweaks when they're handed off to the engineers. In a more collaborative environment, the engineers might be able to start working on one aspect of the design, like the user profile page or the shopping cart feature, while the designers continue working on something unrelated, like the homepage or a navigation bar. Keep in mind, working simultaneously can make a project move more quickly, but might create a need to redo something twice.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There's no right way to hand off designs to production, but there are plenty of options your team can try. As an entry-level UX designer, you won't be responsible for deciding how the hand-off process works, but you will be involved. It's important to build strong relationships with members of your cross-functional team to help the hand-off process go smoothly. The technical logistics of the design hand-off process matter, too.</p>

          <h3>Case study for your portfolio project</h3>
          <p>Your case study should include these ten things.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>1. Your role in the project</b>. State your role in the project. In the real world, you'll mention the team members who collaborated on a design project with you and list the role that each of you played in bringing the designs to life. But for your project in this course, you covered the design process from beginning to end on your own! You should express that in the case study you're creating.</li>
            <li><b>2. The goal of the project</b>. State the purpose of your project based on your findings from the research.</li>
            <li><b>3. Your target audience</b>. Describe the users you tried to solve a problem for or help through your design project.</li>
            <li><b>4. Key challenges or constraints</b>. State the challenges. Some common challenges include things like budget or time constraints.</li>
            <li><b>5. Research conducted</b>. Mention the details of the research study. What research method did you use, and why did you choose it? What issues did the data reveal that led you into the study? How did the research study look? </li>
            <li><b>6. Initial concepts or design strategy</b>. Outline your design process and the decisions you made that contributed to that design. This is a good place to back your decisions with data from any research findings or results of a usability study that informed your design thinking.</li>
            <li><b>7. Your sketches or wireframes</b>. Show visuals of your design. This includes paper sketches, wireframes, and low-fidelity prototypes of your design.</li>
            <li><b>8. Results of any user testing</b>. Discuss the results of user testing. At this point, you want to help others understand why the issues occurred and what the usability tests showed as a result. In other words, what did you learn?</li>
            <li><b>9. Your final polished designs</b>. Showcase your design. You’ll include a mockup or high-fidelity prototype of your design here to wow your audience.</li>
            <li><b>10. Conclusion</b>. State your conclusion and possible next steps. This is your chance to talk about what you learned throughout the design process and to touch on the future direction for the product or possible iterations.</li>
          </ul>

        <div>
          <p>When it comes to documenting design work, designers often showcase their projects through case studies or portfolio presentations. Here are a few common practices:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Visual storytelling</b>: Designers often use visual storytelling techniques to walk viewers through their design process, from initial concept sketches to final deliverables. They may include wireframes, mood boards, prototypes, and high-fidelity designs to illustrate the evolution of their work.</li>
            <li><b>Problem-solving approach</b>: Designers frequently emphasize the challenges they encountered during a project and explain how they addressed them. This helps demonstrate their problem-solving abilities and critical thinking skills, showcasing their ability to overcome obstacles and arrive at effective solutions.</li>
            <li><b>User-centered focus</b>: Designers highlight the user research and insights that informed their design decisions. They may include personas, user flows, or usability testing findings to demonstrate how they considered the needs and preferences of their target audience.</li>
            <li><b>Collaboration and teamwork</b>: Designers often acknowledge and showcase their collaboration with other team members, such as developers, product managers, or stakeholders. They highlight the value of teamwork and how it contributed to the success of the project.</li>
            <li><b>Results and impact</b>: Designers present the outcomes and impact of their work, including metrics, feedback, or testimonials. They emphasize how their design solutions positively influenced user experiences, achieved business goals, or solved specific problems.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            When building your portfolio, consider incorporating the following elements:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Clear project descriptions</b>: Provide concise and compelling descriptions of each project, explaining the context, objectives, and your role in the design process. Clearly communicate the problem you aimed to solve and the impact of your design solutions.</li>
            <li><b>Visual representations</b>: Include visual assets that showcase your design process, such as sketches, wireframes, prototypes, and final designs. Use images or videos to demonstrate interactions, animations, or responsive behavior if applicable.</li>
            <li><b>Design rationale</b>: Explain the reasoning behind your design decisions. Discuss the insights and research that influenced your choices, and how you iterated on your designs based on feedback and user testing.</li>
            <li><b>Before-and-after comparisons</b>: If possible, include visual comparisons that show the improvements or transformations your designs brought to a product or user experience. This can help demonstrate the value you added through your work.</li>
            <li><b>Diversity of projects</b>: Showcase a variety of projects that demonstrate your range of skills and expertise. This can include projects from different domains, such as web design, mobile apps, branding, or user interface design, to showcase your versatility.</li>
          </ul>
            <p>Remember to tailor your portfolio to your target audience and highlight the aspects that make you unique as a designer. Focus on presenting your best work and ensuring the documentation is clear, visually engaging, and effectively communicates your design process and outcomes.</p>
